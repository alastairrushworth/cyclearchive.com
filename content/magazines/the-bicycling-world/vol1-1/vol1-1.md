CURRENTE CALAMO

The jaunty bicycler of the cut on our inside page waves his last good-by to-day. His cap was lost by the wayside long ago ; his bicycle is already antiquated, and the scenes have changed. He is still ahead of his winged pursuer, after two years of the fer\'id race, and is good for another spurt. But the heavy scroll iin pedes ; it is caught from him by a brisker breeze, and gracefully, as a winner should, he dismounts.

" The world was not made in a day," nor is The Bicycling World perfected in one number.

It's Cann and Will both with one of our visiting riders.

Our interpreting bicycler, Patrie, speaks of the visit ing French champion in a way that sounds as "Mr. Tear on." And nitnbly he does Terront.

When the funny man of Harper's Bazar artist corps is proposed for admission to a club, we hope he will not be black-balled on account of his recent giving himself away. It's Worth something to have such an erratic wobbler to amuse us.

"Alas, poor Yor(ic)k!" That bicycle club is re ported to be "a myth," after all. But perhaps the announcement was a prophecy. With a nucleus of four riders it will soon have its club. Already Pennsylvania, with its four, stands next to Massachusetts in its number of these aids to enjoyment.

With its usual enterprise Lippincott's leads the magazines with the first article on the bicycle, though it was not the first to move in the matter. It is a stiff' up-grade to those lofty editorial sancta, but they will all be reached in time.

Whatever their political opinions or expectations may have been, fort)^ wheelmen, at least, will have kindly feelings of loyalty to the new Governor of Massachusetts, and long remember the courtesy which prompted him, in the midst of a busy campaign, to remain at his home in Hingham until one o'clock, that he might ex tend his hospitable cheer and coffee to the far-spinning excursioners.

By the way, if the Governor and Council were " able and discreet" enough to adopt the free and independent bicycle on their usual rounds, what an amount of ex penses would be saved to the State, and how easily the question of free passes could be settled !

It looked very much, last week, as if Harry Etherington had introduced a new commodity of Canned beat to us Americans. But Terront spoiled that joke.

President Chandler, of the Suffolk Bi. C, knows a good run when he finds it. He took one down the Blackstone valley this season, and was greeted by a hearty Uxbridge citizen: "Well, you and Van Amburgh's circus are the only people that's been down this way for twenty year."

People who bow to us at the news-stand should remeinber that our paper is like a nut, in having the meat inside, —and crack it.

"Everyone knows that we have in this country no bicyclists able to make any sort of a show against the Englishmen." — Spirit of the Times^ 8 Nov., 1879. Now how does " every one " know that, Mr. Spirit?

Cann has already been beaten fairly on his fastest mile by two Americans. And bicyclers know that our fast est racing men at present are among the amateurs. Let Mr. Etherington try a match with some of these, or bring on soine amateurs who can. Our sporting con temporary might be just as bright and yet be a little less supercilious towards bicycling.

One thing happens to all alike, —bicyclers or nonbicyclers, —sooner or later we must all take a header, as the parson said when he passed the cemetery.

He came up to us in the tent one evening, last week, a drooping, dreamy-eyed young man, and said, "I have a charming little roundelay on —

"Beautiful, bonnie bright blanket of snow, Downily draping the " —

Here he made a cjesural pause, and tried in vain to lift his hat from his nose and ears. He was borne outside by shivering men in knee-breeches. They rolled him in the "beautiful blanket." They tucked the corners of it into his mouth and neck. They set him on a frostv bicycle, and gave him a start. It was a charming little round he lay on the beautiful, etc., and he felt no doubt, as we did, that it is a cold, cold world —for November.

## THE CLUBS REVIEWED

## I. THE SUFFOLK BICYCLE CLUB.

This club is the largest in point of membership, and first in the number of its long and short distance amateur riders, of known strength and skill, in America. It was first organized in the spring of 1878, by a number of young gentlemen of Boston, who framed for its government a constitution of eleven articles, twelve bylaws, fourteen road rules, and eight racing rules, all of which, however, were not formally adopted, though for the most part acted under during the riding season of 1878. The strong interest taken by its members soon developed some accomplished riders ; their success encouraged others ; races, both public and private, were engaged in ; the Club grew in numbers, and, at the close of the season in 1878, a new set of rules and a change in organization were found necessary to meet the requirements of a body of this kind.

The first meeting for the reorganization of the Club was held February 27, 1879, when new rules (printed below) , modelled after the best attainable English rules, were presented and adopted. In these rules the English practice was followed, of directing the business of the Club in as simple a way as practicable, because complexity, undesirable in any organization, was specially to be avoided in a club formed for a healthful and pleasurable exercise. From this time the number of members rapidly increased, and the roll, including three honorary members, now numbers eighty.

The growth of the Club necessitated a club-room, which was hard to find, as the requirements of a bicycle club are peculiar. A room, answering the purpose reasonably well, was at last obtained at 36 Charles street, Boston. This club-room is believed to be the most complete of its kind, either in England or America. In England very few bicycle clubs have club-rooms.

The Suflblk Club-room is intended not only to fur nish a convenient place for club meetings, but a read ing-room, where all the periodicals of value relating to bicycling, with the more important sporting papers, English and American, are to be had, as well as a dressing-room, where lockers, with washing accommodations, are at hand as a convenience to riders. The room is also provided with some of the best maps and itineraries of the State, so that members may acquaint themselves with the roads, and arrange tours over any part of the Commonwealth. A bulletin-board is used to convey the latest intelligence, and a complaint or suggestion book is kept for hints or requests as to the con duct of the rooms or wants of members. There is a janitor in charge, whose services the members can com mand, and the rooms are always accessible to members by key.

Without giving the record of its racing members in

detail —a record which has improved with each suc ceeding season, and which has for the most part ap peared in the press of the day —we print below the rules of this Club, together with a list of its present officers and members.

#### RULES.

## TOURS AND EXCURSIONS

## A RUN IN JERSEY.

My winged steed was growing impatient in its stable for want of exercise, and election day presenting a fa vorable opportunity for a run, a number of us agreed to try the Jersey sands. Leaving home at 7 a.m., I proceeded quickly to the polls, where I met a fellow-cycler, and having done our duty to our country, we kept on our way, crossing the Schuylkill by Gray's Ferry bridge, and then through the City of Brotherly Love to South-st. Wharf, where on the Gloucester ferry-boat we found a number of shining steeds w^hose ow^ners greeted us most warmly. The twenty minutes spent in steaming down the Delaware passed most pleasantly as we oiled and tightened our machines, and then sat in the upper cabin and indulged in ludicrous remarks at the expense of passing craft. At 8.20 a.m. we left Gloucester, nine in number, all in high spirits, riding in single file along the southern turnpike, a little sandy at first, but soon hard and firm as any floor. As we rounded the corner at the first toll-gate I looked back and saw a pretty sight as the steel spokes glistened in the morning sunlight and the blue and gray shirts (representing respectively the Philadelphia and Germantown clubs) marched straight on with a narrower gauge than even the new railroad to Atlantic City. The Jersey turnpikes are generally made of fine gravel, rounded well up in the middle, and sloping more or less abruptly down on either side, with one good w^agon track that is quite hard, and with soft slopes outside of it ; but the drivers were mostly considerate enough to turn out for us a foot or two, and allow us to go by them without changing our course. In thirty minutes we reached Woodbury (5 m.) where we joined the citizens in run ning to a small fire ; but the old-fashioned hand fire engine which they brought out was not even put into use, so we soon took up the line of march, and at 9 a.m. were on our way down the incline to Mantua creek. A drove of steers going in the same direction w^as a decided hindrance for some time, and one large animal turned directly across my path, so that I ran plump into his side ; he was less incommoded than I was, but I soon remounted, and with the others toiled up Cooper's hill, not steep but long, and with the strong westerly wind it made us blow. At Mantua (3 m.) the people stared, with mouths wide open, but on we sped ; our ranks now scattered through Lawrenceville, then down a smart incline with legs over handles to Raccoon creek and up to MuUica hill (5 m.), where at 9.50 we halted to give ourselves some water and our machines some oil. Ten minutes sufficed to bring six of us together, and we turned slightly to the right, along a ridge with beautiful views of Pennsylvania far away across the river. Dinner had been ordered at Woodstown (8 m.), and my animal seemed to be imbued with my own feelings, for away he flew up hill and down along the splendid road, and at 10.50 I leaped from the saddle in front of the hotel and was warmly welcomed by mine host. Some of my

:

I

;

companions were rather later, but by 1 2 o'clock we all seated ourselves around a table fairly groaning with vegetables and pastrj', and did full justice to the roast chicken and roast beef set before us, twenty miles having given us all good appetites.

Three of the part)' determined to take the train back to Philadelphia, and five concluded to ride directly back to Gloucester ; but I wanted to see a little more of Jersey, though it was too late for either water-melons or musquitoes ; so leaving at i p.m., I kept on to Salem (10 m.) doing it in fifty minutes. As I halted here to oil and water, a crowd of four or five hundred gathered around, and one man, so drunk that he caught hold of the backbone of my machine to steady himself, said that he himself had come that morning on a bicycle down from Philadelphia. Mounting at 2.10 p.m., I retraced my steps, but there was a furious head-wind, and though I made Woodstown in fifty-five minutes, and Mullica hill in fifty minutes more, yet the fierce blasts (a snowsquall, too, enlivened the scene) chilled me, and when I reached Woodbury, at 5.25 p.m., it was dark ; so I took the train for the city. On reaching the foot of Market street I felt rested and warmed, so I rode on the Belgian blocks up to Broad street, and then out Walnut street and over Chestnut-street bridge, reaching home in good time, and feeling very comfortable both in mind and body after my sixty-eight miles, most of which was ridden at the rate of ten miles an hour.

Mercurv.

## CLUB DOINGS

Boston Bi. C. —At a regular meeting held on Monday evening, November 3, 1879, *^w° matters of especial interest were agitated.

The ''head-quarters" of this club are and for some time have been divided, the head-quarters proper being at the rooms of the Secretary, 178 Devonshire street, and the stabling, lavatory, etc., on Boylston street, three fourths of a mile away. The procuring of suitable meeting-room, reading-room, dressing-room, and appropriate space for leaving and care of machines, all to gether and conveniently located, has heretofore been difficult to effect. In bringing up the subject at this time, one member proved his earnestness and interest in the club by oflering to head a private subscription, in aid of the Treasurer's funds for that object, with fifty dollars. He was of course placed on the committee thereupon appointed, which consists of MM. E. C. Hodges, F. Butler, and J. S. Dean.

The Secretary laid before the club certain correspond ence which had passed between him as Secretary of this club, and Mr. A. H. Curtis, Secretary of the National Association of Amateur Athletes of America, relative to the status of Mr. Will R. Pitman, of this city, as an amateur. The question comes before a committee of that association, by reference from the Union Athletic Club of Boston, on the 13th instant. Upon consideration of the correspondence and its subject-matter, the following vote was unanimously passed : —

Voted, That our Secretary be directed to communicate to the Secretary of the National Association of Amateur Athletes, the respectful protest of this club against any adjudication which shall impose upon amateur clubs the courtesy or neces-

u*^

sity of recognizing Mr. Will R. Pitman as an amateur, and to inform the Secretary that this club has as reasons for consider ing him a professional, the personal knowledge of its members of facts making him so under the rules of that association, a decision of a board of judges officially appointed by the City of Boston, after a hearing and under circumstances and so composed as to be entitled to respect, and also the apparent fact that, failing to make his claims to amateurship availing in Massachusetts, he has taken the matter to New York in an attempt to reinstate himself there, where it is difficult to pro duce the evidence, and to force himself upon the amateurs at home thereby.

MM. Geo. B. Woodward and W. W. Allen were appointed as committee on the part of this club to unite with a similar committee from the Mass. Bi. C. and arrange for a joint meet and two days' run during the month. — It was also voted to have a meet and run of this club on Thanksgiving Day.

Brockton Bi. C. — This club was founded i June, 1879. It has adopted an entrance fee of one dollar, other dues to be assessed as needed ; costume, gray helmet cap with blue trimmings, gray shirt and knee breeches with blue trimmings ; and head-quarters at Belmont Club, Room 5, Lyman Block, Main St.. Colors and badge not yet decided upon. Officers elected were : Pres't and Capt., R. W. Shaw ; Sec'y and Treas., Fred B. Howard, Home National Bank, Brockton, Mass.

Harvard Bi. C.—At a meeting held 31 Oct., in Holden Chapel, it was voted to accept the invitation of the Suflblk Bi. C. to join them in their races at Clyde

;

.

Park, on Clyde street, Brookline, Mass., on Saturday, the 15th inst. The matter of whole-day runs was re ferred to the executive committee, with the suggestion that the first ride take place on the 8th inst. By permission of the college authorities, the club will use the building lately occupied by John Wilson & Son, for a rink this winter.

This club was founded 17 April, 1879. Its entrance fee and subscription are by assessment as needed ; colors, crimson and blue ; badge, letters H. B. C. in monogram of club colors ; costume, polo cap with monogram in front, jacket, breeches, and stockings, all of gray ; its officers are: Pres't, R. C. Sturgis (81); Capt., M. Tilden (81) ; Sec'y and Treas., J. H. Storer (82), Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass.

Lynn Bi. C. We learn from the Boston Herald that a largely attended meeting of bicyclers was held on the fifth November instant, at the residence of Mr. W. O. Faulkner, in Lynn, Mass., for the purpose of forming a bicycle club. After organization, officers were chosen : Pres't, Edward S. Freeman ; Sec'y, Henry H. Fuller Treas., F. J. Faulkner; Capt., W. O. Faulkner; Sub-Capt., Albert S. Fuller; and a few other officers and committees were chosen. There was much interest shown, and there is good prospect of a large and flour ishing club in Lynn when the next season opens. We hope to hear from the secretaiy.

Massachusetts Bi. C. has appointed a committee on arrangement for more suitable head-quarters, consist ing of MM. W. S. Slocum, A. S. Parsons, and H. E. Parkhurst. The committee on the part of this club, on the joint meet and run with the Bostons, are MM. E. W. Pope and Dr. C. H. Corken.

## RACES

## THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH CHAMPIONS IN BOSTON.

It was intended to hold a 100-mile race, in which the above riders were to be heavily handicapped against all comers, on Saturday, Nov. i, and for that purpose, as well as for the ensuing races, which had then been partly arranged, a boarded track of eight laps to the mile had been laid on a vacant lot of land at the corner of Huntington avenue and West Newton street. This track was to be covered with a tent, and doubtless would have been but for the furious gale which was blowing during the closing days of the week, and which rendered the raising of a tent of such large proportions an impossibility. The managers then de cided that they would postpone the 100-mile race, and begin a 6-days' race, of 10 hours each day, on Monday ; but this plan, too, had to be given up, in deference to the elements, until finally it was determined to start a 4-days' race on Wednesday, Nov. 5, in which William Cann and Chas. Terront were to hold the track against all comers, and to allow any of such no less than 10 miles in every 100 miles, which might be covered. This bold challenge brought acceptances from Thos. Harrison (Boston) ; Prof. Rollinson (Philadelphia) ; Geo. Harrison (Boston); Murphy (Worcester); and Lowder (Somerville) ; each of whom appeared at the time appointed.

The Board of Judges were Messrs. C. E. Pratt, President Boston Bi. C. ; Frank W. Weston, Secretary Boston Bi. C. ; E. C. Hodges, Acting Captain Boston Bi. C. ; and H. E. Parkhurst, Secretary Mass. Bi. C.

At 9.10 a.m. on the 5th, the men were sent off. The morning was cold and the air inside the tent chilly, so that the men settled down to their work at once in self defence from the temperature.

The second day (Wednesday) brought a sprinkling of spectators, in spite of the falling snow, to see the start, which was effected promptly at 9 a.m., by Geo. Harrison, the other riders following as they got ready, up to 9.15, when all were on the track.

The third day (Thursday) brought clear skies and fine weather, and quite a large audience to see the start, which was made as usual, punctually at 9 a.m. The closing day of the race brought settled fine

weather and a large attendance of spectators, which, as evening approached, grew still larger until towards the finish it assumed proportions which must have been gratifying to the managers and the racers.

The following is the complete record of the distances

## THE 60-HOUR PROFESSIONAL RACE.

The 60-hour professional race between Mr. Harry Etherington's Anglo-Franco team and five American professionals terminated at 12 o'clock, on Saturday night last, at the tent on Huntington avenue, Charles Terront, William Cann, and Geo. Harrison taking respectively ist, 2d, and 3d places.

The race was governed by the Wolverhampton rules, both Terront and Cann allowing the Americans ten miles in every hundred. Winners to cover the follow ing distances to obtain prizes: ist prize, $1,000, to cover 800 miles ; 2d prize, $500, to cover 750 miles ; 3d prize, $250, to cover 700 miles ; 4th prize, $100, to cover 650 miles. The entries were as follows : Charles Terront, William Cann, Thomas Harrison, Geo. Harrison, R. S. Rollinson, Murphy, and Louder. As the event was the first professional race in this country when men of any note were entered, it was looked forward to with great interest by all friends of bicycling. The inclemency of the weather prevented many from witnessing the race, and the extreme cold of Wednesday and Thursday caused considerable suffering among the contestants. From the start Terront and Cann took Ihe lead and alternately held it until the finish, and it soon became evident that unless some serious accident occurred to either of them they would be easy winners. That fact once settled, the interest centred upon the occasional spurts between the men. Rollinson showed himself the fastest man on the track for a short distance, but taking into consideration both endurance and speed Terront was by far his superior. This plucky little Frenchman finished second in the last 6 days' (iS hours

each day) contest in Agricultural Hall, London, with 1,390 miles to his credit, and is looked upon by judges as the fastest long-distance rider in the world. He is credited with the fiistest mile made during the race ; his 63Sth mile being made in 3.10. He rode a 52-inch D.H.F. Premier racer. William Cann, who took second place, rode a 54-inch Stanley racer, and proved himself to be a plucky and steady rider.

The sport has hardly attained growth enough in this country to enable us to name professionals to compete successfully with our English cousins, but it is hoped that before long America will be able to name men of equal endurance and speed. The riding of the Americans improved steadily as the race progressed, and had they kept steadily on tlie track, their chances of making a good record would have improved. No pains weie spared by the management to provide suitable accommodations for the spectators. On Saturday evening the tent was fairly filled, and it was a noticeable fact that quite a large number of ladies were present. Below may be found a summary of the distances covered by each man : Chas. Terront, 660 miles ; William Cann, 628 miles, 6 laps ; Geo. Harrison, 440 miles, i lap ; T. Harrison, 400 miles; R. S. Rollinson, 321 miles; Murphy (withdrawn) ; Louder (withdrawn). The track was 8 laps to the mile, but too narrow, being only ten feet, and the corners were suitably inclined. Cann's fastest mile was his 181 st, in 3.2,1 ; T. Harrison's 383d mile was made in 3.12 ; Rollinson's best was his 24th, in 3.13 ; Geo. Harrison's 278th was in 3.32, and Murphy's best time was 3.50 ; while Terront's 638th was made in 3.10. It will be observed that neither of the foreigners reached either of the three highest distance limits set by the management for reaching to obtain prizes. H.

Keen vs. Stanton, 50 miles. — The same tent, or Bicycle Park as it is locally called, was the scene of a contest between John Keen and David Stanton, in a fifty-mile race, on Monday evening, the loth inst. ; this being the first of a series of competitions to last through the week, under the same management. Keen rode a 56-inch Eclipse, weighing 34 lbs., and Stanton rode a 56-inch Humber, of 35 lbs. weight. Stanton had a start of 2^ laps, and the race was a very exciting one. We shall describe it more fully in our review of the week's events in our next issue ; but give here the time made, as follows : Keen completed his 20th mile, ih. 13m. 7s. ; his 25th in ih. 38m. Stanton retired on the seventh lap of his 33d mile. Keene's fifth and fastest mile was in 3.28, and his last mile in 3.50, and a summary fol lows : —

## PERSONAL

Who are the Co. } This question will doubtless arise with our readers, and we do not hesitate to say here, what the request of our modest and liberal patron has prevented us from putting in a more prominent place.

They will be glad to know that one of them is acting Captain Edward C. Hodges, of the Boston Bi. C, whose manly and energetic bearing and accomplishments have made him conspicuous on the long runs and over-night excursions in New England, and at many races there and elsewhere. We point to him as not only a strong financial, but the fighting associate of our staff.

Mr. John C. Sharp, jr., while in England this season, learned many points in racing, it is said ; and while there made his mile in 2.59. We hope the report that he will enter no more races is untrue, for he is one of the fleetest and most graceful amateur riders we have, and has already made a record to be proud of.

President Longstreth and we were " digs " together at college, and we can well understand both his success and enthusiasm as a wheelman, and his popularity with others.

He of the many victories. Captain Johnson, to wit, is not, we hope, like the great warrior of antiquity, weeping for more worlds to conquer. We should like to see him meet Mr. Etherington and Mr. J. C. Sharp in the same race for say two miles.

It is said that Mr. Willie Wright has forsaken the cinder-path since his ride at Mott Haven, Sept. 27.

## CORRESPONDENCE

#### Pittsburg, Penn., Nov. 6, 1879. Editor of The Bicycling World : —

The news of a new -world has just reached us ; and,' as the bicycle has been its advance agent, wheel talk should abound in its expected-to-be bright and new^sy columns. Every bicycler in this smoke-creating burgh will no doubt give The Bicycling World the support its enterprising company deserves. Give us our paper regularly, and depend upon it the lovers of the wheel will give it a hearty reception. We have long felt the need of a wide-awake gazetteer devoted to our healthgiving, fascinating, practical, steed of steel ; hence we welcome The World. If managers or directors of races, excursions, club or general meets, will use your advertising columns to bring their events before bicycleriders early enough to enable them to enter and participate, they will aid in establishing the paper, and there by recognize it as the authority on all points pertaining to bicycling. _ t^ t ^ ^ Leydon Bard, Jr.

#### Detroit, Mich., Oct. 28, 1879. Editor of The Bicycling World: —

The interest in bicycling is slowly but surely on the increase in our city ; new members join our club at each business meeting, and the increase of their love for the " wheel," as a means of exercise and enjoyment, is clearly shown by those who have had it in use longest. Our Detroit, provided as it is with miles of smooth wood pavements, affords facilities which not every city can boast of for bicyclers ; and though when we wish to take long country rides we find Canada roads the smoothest and best adapted for riding, yet our 'cyclers find that an hour or two can be spent very enjoyably spinning along our streets. Some very pleasant rides

have been made to the adjacent villages and towns by small parties of our riders.

The Captain of the Detroit Bi. Club, N. B. Conger, has so far made the longest one day's run in this vicinity. Starting from Windsor, at eight o'clock one morning, he made the run to Leamington and return, a distance of seventy miles. The actual running time, exclusive of stops, was seven hours and twenty minutes. Some parts of the run w^ere made in good time, one twelve miles being accomplished in fifty minutes, and that against quite a stiff head-breeze. Moonlight rides are being indulged in these clear nights, and those who engage in them claim that it would be hard to get up a

more enjoyable affair than a moonlight bicycle ride. A gold medal for the club championship is being talked of, and no doubt at the next club meeting, to be held on Monday evening next, the talk will assume definite shape, and a race be arranged for.

I, for one, am sorry that it seems fated that bicycling, while yet in its infancy in our country, is to be taken hold of by the " sporting" and gambling fraternity, and used by them for their purposes, and thus degraded ; for undoubtedly those who engage in it will soon de scend to the level of the pedestrians, oarsmen, and other exponents of athletic exercises who have done so much to lower these sports in the estimation of all fair minded lovers of them. The mention of any profes-* sional contest in either walking, running, rowing, or wrestling, brings at once to the mind the idea of fraud, and so dispels any interest that might arise were these affairs fair trials of strength, skill, or agility. It seems to have been clearly demonstrated of late that, where the winning or losing of large sums of money is at stake, the average degree of honesty found in the professional athlete is not proof against the temptation to resort to the fraud and trickery that will enable him to become possessed of what he deems his share of the money in the pool-box or otherjvise at stake.

Bicycling, as a gentlemanly exercise, and for the sake of the healthful sport to be derived from it, is something that every lover of it should by all means in his power encourage ; while bicycling, as an exhibition of what are called the staying powers and the going qualities of phenomenally endowed professionals, and the attendant gambling connected with such an exhibition, is something that every honest 'cycler ought to con demn. The importation of professionals ought to be discouraged by every means ; and these contests that will be arranged for are not deserving of the notoriety that they receive from the press, nor of the patronage they get from the public. While there may be some honest men engaged in them, yet, on the whole, they will turn out to be money-making schemes, gambling frauds, and anything but exhibitions that w^ill tend to elevate the morals of the masses, or beget a healthful interest in our noble sport. Go as I Please.

#### Philadelphia, November 11, 1879.

JEditor Bicycling World: — Most gladly do we welcome you to your place among the current literature of the day, and we feel full confidence that you will fill most acceptably your much-needed office. Although we, in this conservative and quiet city, have not entered into the spirit of bicycling as have you of the " Hub," owing in great measure to the wretched paving of our

streets, yet w^e are beginning to be aroused, and certainly claim the second rank among the cities of America.

The Philadelphia Club now has twenty-two membeis, and the Germantown Club about half that number, while the unattached swell the total to over a hundred. The privileges afforded us by the Park Commission, though limited as to time and space, have given us a foothold in that delightful pleasure-ground, and promise us a rich treat in the future. The riding-school at Horticultural Hall, in the centre of the city, is a great source of attraction both to learners and those more ex perienced, and affords the votaries of the wheel a pleas ant place in which to spend an evening hour and discuss the latest news. Indeed, we are getting quite w^ide awake, and intend to give the Bicycling World a hearty greeting and an earnest support. Wishing you every success, I am Yours truly,

Thomas K. Longstreth, Pres't Phila. Bi. Club.

### GREETING.

We come before the public, in fresh new guise, without apology, and without promises except to be a regular visitant and to do the best we can to be agreeable, truthful, and wide awake. We believe in the permanent future of the bicycle as a means of practical loco motion, as a delightful enabler to rational recreation and a health-preserver, as a refined and humane instrument of competitive athletics, and as the subject of a large and useful industry. We share in the generous social club spirit which it has awakened. We feel alive to the multitudinous interests, questionings, enjoyments, dis coveries, and experiences arising out of the uses of the wheel, and we mean to voice them in our columns. If we interpret rightly tlie signs of the time there is a ripe demand for such a journal as ours proposes to be —impartial, accurate, tasteful, regular, comprehensive — not hitherto answered in this country. Entering upon this field as we do, with faith in our principal (but by no means exclusive) theme and in the good-will of the public to which we appeal, and founded upon a sound basis of funds and resources, we must yet bespeak that active

We are frank and confidential in asking ; shall we re ceive .''

Since the eighteenth issue of 7^/ie American Bicycling jfournal went to press, it and its tangible properties have been transfered to the proprietors of this paper, and it will appear no more. With pluck and generosity of time and means, the sanguine editor of the yournal took it from a premature and precarious foundation as the exponent of an importing firm, and has carried it through a career beset with difficulties so far towards success. Under his unique and familiar heading he makes at this time on our opposite page a parting bow. Our readers will be glad to know that he does not there by quit the field he has gi^aced so well, and that his ready pen will continue to contribute to the columns of the World, of which he will be an associate editor. While this paper is in no sense a continuation of that, and has no connection with it except by purchase and absorption, we hope the favor it has received and the influences which have aided it will in future be accorded to ours, and that we may merit them as well.

## THE SIXTY-HOUR RACE.

As to the value of professional contests to the best in terests of bicycling, there is an open question. Our correspondent in another column makes some strictures on that phase of the sport, drawn chiefly, no doubt, from his observation of other athletic competitions, from which it is but just to- say that the sixtj^-hour i"ace in Boston last week was mostly free.

This race is of peculiar interest in several aspects. It was the first protracted bicycling contest in America, and was participated in not only by five of our home professionals, but by two of the twelve best riders in the world. The latter have been years acquiring their skill and power and adding to their accomplishments. The former were comparatively novices ; most of them with little previous experience, with no careful training, without adequate care and attendance during the race, with no prior test of their ability or endurance to gauge their eflbrts by through so many consecutive hours, with heavier machines, they had many disadvantages and much to learn. These considerations were oflset in whole or in part by the ten per cent, odds allowed them, so far as winning was concerned, but in any comparison of their riding they need to be borne in mind. As a great race it was a failure. The failure began with those who undertook to prepare the track and the tent ; the track was too narrow by four or five feet, and neither the walk nor the tent was in ready condition for the start, though the public had already been four times

## THE KING IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE KING

!

Nearly two years ago (Dec, 1877) the initial number of the "American Bicycling Journal" made its bow to a constituency of six riders, and a contingent of possibly a few hundreds of readers. To-day, with a constit uency of some thousands of riders, and of readers an unknown quantity, it gracefully resigns its personality, and becomes merged in the stronger enterprise, of the initial number of which it forms a part. We may per haps as well confess that it is not without some senti mental regret that we take this action ; but the regret is akin to that with which the father beholds his boy entering upon the manhood which is to free him from the parental care, and is swallowed up in the exultation with which we regard our bantling publication, intro duced in the face of an apathy and ignorance as to our sport, so dense as almost to constitute opposition, now so universally appreciated, that the talent and the capital which have heretofore been lacking in our enterprise have so soon been found and enrolled in the cause of our glorious sport.

We need not recapitulate the disadvantages under which we have labored in the production of the past eighteen numbers of our "Journal," for we have unfor tunately had too frequently to refer to them in its col umns. We prefer rather to point with pride to the fact, that in spite of all these opposing forces we have met with such encouragement and right hearty good-will and assistance from our readers that we have been enabled to produce thereby in all nearly sixty thousand copies, comprising some eight hundred thousand pages, of a

"Journal," which, however glaring its faults and defi ciencies may have been, must of necessity have carried some information and influence with it wherever it cir culated.

In the beginning our work was necessarily largely of a missionary character. In this country the bicycle w^as a new, an untried experiment, and our earlier issues found ample field for the dissemination of facts proving its practicability as an instinjment of enjoyable locomotion. This necessity, however, did not last for a great while. The energy and enterprise of our manufacturing and importing houses in the bicycle trade soon spread the news that the tireless horse stood ready to the people's hand, and we began to perceive unmistakable indications that the bulk of our readers would not long remain contented with the reiteration of facts proving what to them, at least, was as stale news as would have been the statement that a loaf of bread was good to eat.

Then came the time for the incorporation of new features in our work, so that while it should still be of interest and attractiveness to the novice and the tyro, the rapidly increasing army of experts should be supplied with the facts which they, too, needed, and that the rec ord of American Bicycling should be complete in all its departments. To the accomplishing of this end we at once bent our energies, and although the eflbrt was for some time attended with serious pecuniary loss we continued to persevere, — with what success we leave our readers to determine, — until at last the constantly increasing interest in our publication assumed such pro portions as to ensure its stability and permanence.

We thus briefly touch upon the past of the first venture in bicvcling journalism, so that our readers

may the more easily comprehend the motives which have actuated us in our arrangements for the future, which we will now still more briefly, if possible, explain.

Bicycling has attained already, in this country, such proportions that it is no longer possible for individual effort to produce an organ which shall worthily and creditably occupy the immense field before it; to do this, collective enterprise, energy, and ability have become absolute necessities. We have therefore allied ourselves with two gentlemen, each vs^ell known as earnest advocates of our sport, as well as skilful exponents of its utility.

Our publication under the old title has, in meeting its many adversities, been so frequently compelled to temporaril}'^ succumb, that a certain reputation for irregularity has become attached to it. This irregularity is no longer necessary, nor will it in future be permitted.

In the conduct of our bantling "Journal," we have said and written and done such as lay within the scope of our ability ; but for the same reasons that the skipper of a river-steamer w^ould surrender the wheel to more able hands in a voyage and on a craft "which ploughs the ocean," so we in our joint proprietorship of a paper which we aim to make superior to most, and second to none, of the ventures on the field of bicjcling journalism, surrender the reins of editorial management, and shall rest supremely content if in our "associate" capacity we can say or write or do aught to forward the common cause of both the readers and the proprietors of this paper.

To our old subscribers we would say that w^e have not neglected their interests, and that the first eight numbers of the new paper, making in all the twentysix numbers which we have promised them, will be forwarded as usual, and without extra cost, as issued.

To our old readers, and to the many friends of whose sympathy and regard we have received substantial tokens, we would tender our grateful thanks, not less for their kindness than for their forbearance, and would assure them that under the new regime we shall continue our best efforts in the interests which it has been, and will continue to be, our aim to advance.

deceived and disappointed by advertised engagements that they should be so. No wonder that the attendance was not large. Then the wind and snow and cold of an exceptionally cruel and severe November opening made it chilling and even dangerous for both the public and the competitors. Muffled in coats and ffannels, numb to sleepiness, seized with cramps and bruised by falls, they were plucky fellows to ride at all during the

first three days ; and on the fourth day they loafed. They did not ride the full time at all ; they toyed with their bouquets, chatted with their chums and lady friends, and an hour before their time expired, when all were in a cheerful condition for making many miles more, all the Americans were off" the track, the Englishman was smoking a cigar, and looking up "Jack" and " Dave," and the Frenchman was whistling and singing along for a few laps more, —his music being much more entertaining than the fitful and feeble attempts of the band had been. Looking at it as a whole it was almost a farce ; and yet many of the scenes and incidents were pretty and even brilliant. On comparing the aggregate distances and time with those in recent long races abroad, the result is favorable neither to the for eigners nor to the Americans. The fastest miles look better for both ; Terront's 3.10 and Cann's 3.21 being not only creditable for them in so long a race, but leav ing T. Harrison's 3.12 and Rollinson's 3.13 much more creditable under the circumstances. Rollinson displayed the utmost grace in riding, and G. Harrison showed that he has the pluck and the power to contend well with the best when he has eaten more steaks and learned how to put himself in training.

## THE BROCKTONS IN COURT.

The case of the five members of the Brockton Bi. C, who were fined $10 and costs on a spiteful complaint in the lower court, came Up on appeal before Mr. Justice Wilkinson, in the Superior Court at Plymouth, Mass., last Friday. After the evidence against them was all in, the jury was instructed toi return a verdict of not guilty, and the defendants were acquitted. How the verdict was received by their neighbors appears in " Our Exchanges," in another column. As this was the first criminal prosecution of a bicycler in this country, it has excited considerable interest. We piurpose to revert to the subject of Sunday riding in a future number.

The interesting review of the Suffolk Club, which appears in another column, is from the pen of the accomplished president of that thriving organization. More contributions are promised from the same source. The rules appended are simpler and briefer than any yet published. We intend that the club review thus begun (excepting rules, generally) shall extend in future numbers to all the clubs, and trust that this feature may be of value as a record, and partly answer the frequent question of the unattached, —Of what use are clubs .i*

The Suffolk Bi. C. may well point with pride to the names of their honorary members, and generous patrons of our common interest.

Our New York letter is unavoidably crowded out of this number, but will appear in our next.

## SPECIAL NOTICES

Rockwell and Chuchill, Printers, 39 Arch St., Boston, are to be credited with much of the mechanical taste and excellence in the make-up of this paper.

Bicyclers resident or visiting in New York city will find cordialitj' and elegance at Mr. Wentworth Rollins' new quarters over Nos. 115 and 117 W. Twenty-third street.

The hollow-spoke " Carver" bicycles, are not only a novelty in this country, but a rarity in fine mechanical make or finish. See advertisement.

## COMING EVENTS

Suffolk and Harvard Club races at Clyde Park, on Clyde street, Brookline, Mass., on Saturday, 15th inst.

The joint meet and run of the Boston and Massachusetts Clubs has been fixed for Friday, the 14th inst., at 8 a.m. Meet at Trinity Church in Boston, run to South Framingham and back, by different routes, and supper at Hotel Brunswick at 6 p.m.

Men of muscle should not forget the open mile handicap given by the Manhattan A. C. on their fine path, Thanksgiving Day. We understand that if Captain Sharp enters, he will find an opponent, who, although once defeated, is ready and anxious to participate in another friendly contest with him.

## HEADERS

Bicycler to Rustic : " I say, my lad, where does this road go to .'' " — Rustic : " It goos nowheres ; just stands weer 'tis." — " Yes ; but where shall I get to if I go down it.'" —"To the fur eend if ye goo fur anuft"." — Cycling.

We speak in no spirit of egotism when we say that we are the only bic^xling editor who is really a practical rider. —Bicycling Times. This is rather hard on our noble self. — Cycling. The modest islander hadn't seen our World then, nor ridden with us, either. But Harry has now, and given it up. He couldn't Well 'ford to say it at home ; but 'e got Ms m-atch against the wind here.

" Hands off," as the circular saw said to the fellow who tampered with it. — Boston Courier. That's tooth in for a joke, and too sawdid to steel ; but it clips all the same.

The backbone of De Noeille's exhibition machine at the American Institute is as limp as a July picnic collar. Try it.-* — No, thank you. Haven't had a tumble for three months, so are out of practice.

Some of our races seem rather gaseous., to say the least. Rochester and Suffolk failures won't raise us very high, as a bicycling community, in the eyes of our British cousins.

The gentleman from Newton, Boston, Philadelphia, or Cleveland, —we don't know which it is now — who certainly excels in slow racing, burst out in the city of brotherly affection, last month, with a two-mile " rec ord " of 6 min. 52J sec. An investigation of this " best American record" reveals the fact that the two miles was minus 352 yards. O Jabez 1

## QUERIES AND ANSWERS

W., N. Y. — ^. My measure is 35 inches, as nearly as I can make it. Should I venture on a 54, or stop at a 52 ? At 100 turns a minute, each 2 inches of size makes 3,141 feet an hour (about six-tenths of a mile) difference in speed.

A. You should take a 52-inch wheel for road use. Speed doesn't depend altogether on size of wheel. Some of the fastest times have been made on 50-inch wheels against those of 56 inches. The machine should fit, like boots.

J. G. D., Boston. A. Thank you for the suggestions ; they will be considered.

H. B. T., Pittsburg. A. See our Club Directory on another page.

S., Newton. ^. I would inquire, through your columns, what is the best record of Prof. Rollinson, of Philadelphia, prior to the sixty-hour race in Boston.'

54-iN. D. H. F. — Q^ Will some one kindly tell me how to prevent the soldered clasp of my "Pope" Cyclometer from shaking loose on rough roads.? Could it be brazed instead of soldered? The balls in my ^olus bearings click in working hard up hill. They run beautifully, without side shake, but may need tightening. Can any one tell me if that is the trouble "i

## INVENTION AND MANUFACTURE

Few inventions relating directly to the bicycle have found their way to the Patent Office in this country the present year, and no patents thereon have yet been issued. Fourteen patents have been granted, relating to velocipedes, as reported by C. E. Pratt, Esq., Solicitor of American and Foreign Patents, 40 Water street, Boston, viz. : —

No. 211,868 is for an ice velocipede. No. 212,492 is for a tricycle. No. 216,231 shows an ingenious hammock-seat ar rangement for a two-wheeled velocipede.

## RELATIVE ATHLETICS

A Reno, Nevada, gentleman claims to have covered 154^ miles in ten hours, with roller skates, on a track of twenty laps to the mile. It sounds rather dizzy.

And now comes St. Julien, the California trotter, with his mile in 2.12}, and his half mile in 1.06, and makes a still wider gap between the horse and the bicycle for short-distance racing.

At cricket, the All England Eleven have beaten all competitors thus far, including the Young Americas and the Merions. Capt. Daft has not yet met the Dorians of Haverford college, who recently won as handsomely over the Young Americas as his English team did on the 17th and i8th ult.

## TRICYCLES, VELOCIPEDES, ETC.

The four or five tricycles proper in use in this country are but forerunners. This is the true type of veloci pede for practical use, and is in great favor with our English and French cousins, especially the former, where many clubs are already formed for the encour agement and enjoyment of it, and where races are had with it. It is a sister of the bicycle, and is the suitable counterpart for the use of the bicycler's sister, or wife, or lady friend, who may wish to accompany him before she has courage to adopt a dress which w^ill admit of her mounting the better and more fascinating wheel. More patents are issued in England, of late, for improvements in bicycles in a month than for bicycles in a year, and perfection is not sO nearly reached. We shall chronicle some of the events with them and describe some of their improvements in construction.

Nor shall we be unmindful of the velocipede made for the little fellows, the making of which is so large an industry, and the use of which is so healthful and con ducive to good riding in the same boys after a larger growth. In fact we shall count nothing altogether for eign to us which pertains to that multiform mechanical contrivance, the driven and supporting wheel.

## OUR EXCHANGES

'•'•The indispensable sex." —If any daring person inquires why ladies cannot ride the bicycle, he must address the inquiry not to Nature, which has interposed no objection, but to the same irrational conventionalism which has decreed to the female equestrian an ungraceful, inconvenient side-saddle and a trailing robe that make her helpless while in her seat and endanger her life as soon as unseated. True, she rides, but in spite of these obstacles —by dint of her wit and innate gracefulness ; so she walks —on nanow soles and French heels. Give her —or, rather, let her dare to take —for the occasion, not that terrible bloomer, but some modification of sensible gymnasium or short dress, and she will quickly adapt it to satisfy all requirements of delicacy and grace, and will thus be able to mount this swift steed now a-waiting her — a steed which fits well enough the Nature-woman, but cannot make itself to fit skirt-civilization. The male biped will not willingly leave her behind on his multipedal steed, nor will she long consent to be left. — y, Wilcox., in Novetnber Lippincott's.

#### THE BICYCLERS ACQUITTED.

NO CASE FOUND AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF THE BROCKTON CLUB.

As most of our readers well remember, five of the members of the Brockton Bicycle Club have been anxiously awaiting the decision of the Superior Court on their appeal from the sen tence of Judge Keith, of the Second District Court, who thought that indulging in 'cycle riding on Sunday was a violation of a chapter of the General Statutes, and accordingly fined five of them $10 and one-fifth of the costs each. The circumstances of the case, so well known to our readers, were such that the boys were confident of innocence, and the interest excited by the result of the first trial has been very wide, every owner of a 'cycle in the State awaiting the result with impatience. Yester day the four young men —one having paid the fine because of

a removal from town —went down to Plymouth with much ap prehension, for, although they felt almost sure that they would be acquitted, the uncertainty of the law is proverbial, and there is no way of correctly prophesying the result of a suit in court. A telegram received at the Advance office last evening, however, says the verdict of Judge Keith is not correct ; that they are not guilty ; in fact that Judge Wilkerson has decided that there is no case against them, and that they can hereafter ride as freely upon Sunday as upon any other day in the week. This result will be hailed with triumph, not only by the bicycle interest, who have all the time thought that bicycle riding was not amenable to the so-called Sunday law (practically a defunct one), but by every one who loves square dealing and to whom the conduct of Fitzgibbons, in instituting a criminal suit against the young men because they would not pay the extortionate amount asked by him for damage done to his vehicle because of the frightening of his horse by the " steel horses,'' has appeared in a most unfavorable light. His little plan of instituting a civil suit against the young men if the criminal one was successful will now be nipped in the bud, and he, as well as the judge who imposed the sentence, will not be the recipients of a high degree of affection from any fair-minded man who has followed the case from the first. — Brockton Advance.

## GLANCES ABROAD

Keen v. Stanton. 100 Miles.—We clip the following from The Bicycling Times (London) of 30th Oct., in relation to the recent 100-mile race in Agricultural Hall: "These old antagonists met to ride a loo-mile race, for a belt value £50, and £50 pounds in money, on Wednesday, 22d ult. The start took place at 4.33 p.m. . . . The men kept together tilj 30 miles, when Keen spurted and lapped Stanton, and he from time to time so increased his lead that at 76 miles Stanton gave up the task as hopeless.
