# Our paper.

The object this paper has in view is to record everything of interest in the Velocipede world.

The advantages the Velocipede offers as a rapid and convenient means of locomotion, are engaging the attention of leading literary and scientific men, both at home and abroad.

It is obviously impossible that all sources of information concerning this attractive novelty should be accessible to any considerable number of even the reading public.

We present to our readers in a condensed form everything wuioh has permanent value and commanding interest concerning Velocipedes will be the object of the Velocipedist.

It will treat impartially of the strength, lightness, superiority, inferiority and general merits of the velocipedes of rival manufacturers, and give to the public the result of its investigations.

A space will be allotted to accurate and reliable accounts of velocipede races; also to the progress the Velocipede is making upon the dramatic stage.

Though we may not be enabled in this, our first issue, to supply all wished for information, we hope to be able in our future numbers to answer all questions, and make our paper a source of, and outlet for everything of importance relating to this new means of locomotion, exercise and amusement. To this end, therefore, we respectfully solicit correspondence from all parts of the country.

# History of the Velocipede.

But little can be found in the literature, or dictionaries and encyclopedias of ancient or modern times, with reference to that little, rapid and convenient mode of conveyance called the Velocipede, which promises to play such an important part in what is called the annihilation of space.

After spending some hours in fruitless and weary researches over musty journals, we finally came across a book called _"Dictionnaire de Conversation,"_ in which, under the word velocipede, we were referred to the word Draisienne; on turning over to which, we find a description of the three-wheeled, arm-movement velocipede, and it ascribes the credit of its invention to a Baron Drais de Saverbrun, about the commencement of the nineteenth century, for which reason it may be said to be one of the first inventions of the age, in more senses than one.

It then goes on to say that the Garden of Tivoli, which, it appears, was at that time the favored resort of the _crême de la crême_ of Parisian society, was the place where this little instrument made its _débût_. The person who prepared the article on the same subject for the American Encyclopedia, commences by giving the well-known derivation of the word from the Latin _velox_, swift, and _pes_, a foot, and defines it as a carriage by means of which the rider propels himself along the ground, and states that it was invented at Manheim. The Velocipede, as originally constructed, appears to have consisted of a bar about five feet long, supported at each end upon a single wheel, that designed for the front, being arranged so as to turn obliquely to the line of the carriage. The rider sat astride the bar, and propelled the machine by the action of his feet on the ground. This vehicle never came in general use, as the _petits crevés_ and the _cocottes_, on whose verdict the success of any new toy depends, would not patronize it because the pleasure of riding it was overbalanced by the labor of propelling it. It was called the _célérifère_ or "make-speed," and disappeared from view as rapidly as its inventor expected it; to roll into public favor, being unable to contend against the shafts of ridicule leveled mercilessly at it. 

Delving French antiquarians have exhumed from the _Journal de Paris_ of July 21, 1779, a description of a vehicle invented by Messieurs. Blanchard & Mesurier, the former the celebrated aeronaut, which was exhibited in the Place Louis XV., named to-day Place de la Concorde, in presence of many members of the French Academy, and a large concourse of ordinary spectators. At the head of the machine was the figure of an eagle, with outspread wings, to which was attached the apparatus with which the driver directed its movements. Behind it was seated an individual who propelled the machine. At a subsequent date, the inventor transported the vehicle to Versailles, and exhibited its capabilities in presence of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and their idle court. At a later date, M. Dreuze made an improvement on the invention, which met with partial success, inasmuch as a certain number of his machines were constructed after his model and distributed among country postmen, who used them with advantage for some time, until a heavy fall of snow rendered them unserviceable, and led to their being ultimately abandoned, greatly to the gratification of that conservative class, who, detesting everything in the way of innovation, had prophesied their failure.

Since that time, up to within a very recent date, all experiments to render the machine subservient to practical purposes appear to have been unsatisfactory and it has only been in general use as a toy modified by having a third wheel. More attention has been paid to originating or perfecting the flying machine. M. Lallement made an improvement on the two-wheeled machine by affixing to the front wheel treadles which should be acted on by the feet, and the success attending his endeavors to ride it was beyond his most sanguine expectations.

After becoming a thorough master of his horse, Mr. Lallement appeared upon the broad paths of the Champs Elysees. His appearance created a _furore_. The gay frequenters of the Park wondered that the strange machine should run so swiftly, or, rather, that it should run at all upon two wheels in a line. He obtained a patent for this tandem velocipede, and sold it to Messrs. Michaux & Co., of Paris, who improved on it.

However excellent and well adapted Mr. Michaux's improved bicycle is for use in Prance, running over the carefully prepared French thoroughfares, it is not adapted to our rough roads. The peculiar features and improvements which have been made on the American machines are that the frame is tubular, thereby securing great strength and lightness. The axle of the hinder wheel is of peculiar construction, constituting in itself an oil-box, by being made tubular and closed at either end by a screw, on the removal of which it may be filled with lard oil ; cotton lamp-wick having been placed loosely in the tubular axle, the oil is by this means fed to the bearing as fast as required, through small holes made for the purpose in the centre of the axle. The old method of oiling from the outside, allows impurities to be carried into the bearing, which difficulty is entirely obviated by this plan of supplying the oil at the centre of the bearing. The saddle is supported on a spring, giving an elastic seat, and is adjustable to suit the length of limb of different riders. The tiller or steering handle is so constructed with a spring that the hands are relieved from the jolting they would otherwise receive when running over ordinary roads, and its design is such that it obliges the rider to maintain an erect position, keeping the chest well expanded. The stirrups are so shaped as to permit the use of the fore part of the foot, and bring the ankle joint into play, thereby relieving the lower limbs from the disagreeable jolting they would otherwise experience, and making the propulsion much easier than when the shank of the foot is used, as is the case with French machines. The bearings are all of composition, and so attached that when worn they may be replaced by others.

# The future of the Bicycle.

Space has been a sort of enemy to enterprise, and a great part of our energies has been devoted to what is called the annihilation of space, and to this end steamboats have been invented, railroads have been projected, which answer very well for the longer distances, where many miles have to be traversed, but for the shorter distances, up to the invention of the velocipede, we have had nothing adequate to our wants. Cars and stages are always disagreeably crowded, and filled with impure air from the breaths of some two score passengers, besides that you always have the agreeable reflection

that you may be seated next to a person in the catching stage of the measles or the small pox; or that he may be a thief or pick pocket, and find on getting out your pocket book and temper gone at the same time. Besides that, cars and stages never take you exactly where you want to go, generally several blocks away, often obliging you to undergo vexatious delays to take cross town lines, while you are shivering in the cold, or drenched by the rain.

Again, hacks are not only expensive, but extravagant, and if you keep a horse, the expenditure attendant is enormous. Besides a good horse should not be risked over a slippery pavement like Broadway, and a good-for-nothing horse is not worth his keep, and no pleasure to drive.

But the two-wheeled velocipede is the animal which is to supersede everything else. It costs but little to purchase and still less to keep. It does not, like one Zedechias mentioned by an old historian, eat cartloads of hay, with carts, horses, and drivers as a relish, just to amuse Louis le Debonnaire, or any other sovereign. It does not, like Jeshurun, wax fat and kick. It is easy to handle. It never "rares up." It won't bite. It needs no check rein or halter, or any unnatural restraint. It is light and little; let alone, it will lean lovingly against the nearest support. It never "flies off" at a tangent unless badly managed, and under no circumstances will it shy at anything. It is not ludibrious, like the young mule, nor does it, like the Morgan colt, cut up in a ridiculously corybantic manner, nor does it in other ways disgrace the memory of its inventor. In its movements it is all grace. Its one gait is so uniform and easy, and beautiful to look at, and simple to analyze, that it would be a shame to speak of a trot in the same breath. When its driver driveth furiously, even as did Jehu, the son of Nimshi, then there may be danger to him who obstructs the way, and will not make room for the flying steed. But otherwise not. When we have nationalized the stranger, do not let us iorget his origin, but where many smooth roads meet, erect to the memory, and in honor of the inventor a brave monument like that which surmounts the grave of him who first gave us pickles, and taught the world how to cure and barrel the bony herring. Let it not be said that the maker of the first bicycle went unrewarded by the descendants of that posterity who forgot Ctesibius, the first organ builder, or him who introduced the gridiron, nor yet those other anonymous benefactors to whom we owe the benefits and blessings derived from the use of door knobs and buttons.

Since the time of Bellerophon, the first equestrian, of Pelethronius, the inventor of the bridle and saddle, of Ericthonius, who drove the first team to wagon; since Thessaly and Epirus and Mycenas began to be known for their blooded stock; since the days when Proteus drove his two legged horses, and the Lapithss spurred their bitted steeds over the plains of Thessaly; from the time since the first horse which Neptune called from the earth with a tap of his trident, there has been no racer or hack to match the Veloce, for elegance, grace, docility and speed. It may not be as intelligent as Bonner's Dexter, or as many of the carnivorous steeds whose appetite for human flesh brought Diomedes to grief. It may not possess that talent which elevated Caligula's favorite horse to the consulship, but with proper management and adequate encouragement, it may become quite as useful to the world as the Thracian horse admired by Virgil, or the beast •which sat for the Egyptian artist's model of pride, or that historic monster which concealed the enemies of Troy, or even as Charlemagne's cob, whose hoof reopened to the world the long hidden springs of Aachen, the Germanic Gettysburg.

# American Enterprise.

We have always claimed, that America kept pace with the rest of the world in the matter of inventions, but from present appearances, our boast is likely to be contradicted by facts. The truth is, we are behind the times. Our much boasted American enterprise is a pleasing delusion. Even after a new improvement has been successfully demonstrated in England or France, we look on it with mistrust, and seem to dread its introduction as an infringement on the established order of things. This must be the conclusion of any one who takes a comprehensive and comparative view of velocipedestrianism in this country and France.

In Paris, and throughout the Empire velocipedes are used regularly as a means of locomotion, by messengers, pedlers, clerks and school boys. Students ride them, learned limbs of the law exercise their legs on them. Every ubiquitous adver. tisement bearer scuds through the streets on the new iron horse.

Government _employés_, and the compositors employed on different journals, ride them. The fashion writers and the fashion leaders rack their brains for the contrivance of velocipede costumes. There are velocipede clubs formed, velocipede championships contested for at velocipede Tournaments.

At night in every crowded thoroughfare, scores of the graceful vehicles with lighted lanterns swinging before them, may be seen deftly threading their way through the throng of carriages, some driving madly toward the outskirts, some with illuminated advertisements borne like banners above them, gliding swiftly and noiselessly up and down, and in the day time hundreds intersect the avenues of the Bois de Boulogne whiz over the smooth pavements of the Boulevards, and the level ways of the Champs Elysees. They are queer looking affairs those veloces, or bicycles, as they are called in Paris, and when a score or more bowl along in the Sunday race at St. Cloud, Vincennes, and elsewhere, or when driven at break-neck speed on the narrow stone parapet at the east side of the Seine, and even down the hundred steps of the Trocade'ro, their riders all the time indulging in gymnastic feats, that would seem to invite certain destruction; the scene is at once novel and inspiring.


# Velocipede Riding Schools.

Several velocipede schools have been established in New York, and several more are in the process of being organized.

__Hanlon Brothers__ Monday evening last will be memorable in the annals of velocipedestrianism, as on that evening the large hall in the building on the north east corner of 10th Street and Broadway, was dedicated to the goddess who presides over all inventions of rapid means of conveyance. The enlivening strains of a band of music cheered and inspired all present. What might be called the inaugural ceremonies of the occasion were the endeavors made by apprentices to straddle the, to them indomitable steed, and the monotonous awkwardness of their attempts was only varied by an occasional unceremonious fall.

After the lapse of about half an hour thus occupied, Frederick Hanlon, a high-priest worthy of offering incense on the altars dedicated to the cause of velocipeding, appeared equipped in raiment suited to the occasion, and mounted on his favorite thoroughbred, of pure American origin. This distinguished acrobat seems to have transferred all his gymnastic and flying trapeze skill to the veloce, and has therefore justly earned the name of the Champion Velocipedist of the world. He seemed to manage his steed with the utmost ease. He cajoled it, and it went "like blazes," he sat upon it side-saddle fashion, and took off his coat, and put it on again. He stood upright on the machine on one leg, all this time going at the rate of 2.40.

The most astonishing feat that he performed was passing between two chairs, while at full speed, and taking one chair in each hand, made a complete circle of the room, depositing the chairs exactly where he had taken them from. He then went up an inclined plane, ten feet long, which had a rise of three feet in that distance. From this point the descent was still more hazardous, being down an inclined plane only five feet six inches long.

__Pearsall Brothers__ at the intersection of Twenty-second Street and Broadway have one of the most popular riding-schools in the city. The locality is particularly advantageous for fashionable denizens situated in the vicinity of the Fifth Avenue Hotel. The school is open at all hours from nine in the morning until nine in the evening. The upper floors are set apart for beginners, while the lower are for those who have learned to ride the wonderful animal, and is surrounded with a railing, otuside of which spectators are permitted to see the performances of the horsemen. There is always a large concourse of spectators anxious to witness their performances, hardly believing that the animal on tandem wheels can be ridden, but like the Apostle Thomas they are convinced by sight.

Mr. Pearsall formerly occupied a prominent and lucrative position with Messrs. Gurney & Son, far famed for photographic art, but foreseeing the future popularity of the velocipede abandoned photography for velocipeding, and his success has been great.

__Barber's__ on Broadway and 47th. Street. This school is fast acquiring a great popularity, and is particularly convenient of access to persons living far up town. The hall is very large and com. modious to practice in, and experts may be seen at all hours, attempting all kinds of breakneck feats.

__Burnham's.__ The well-known gymnast, Mr. Burnham, has opened a velocipede riding school in Brooklyn, and great success has already attended his enterprise.

# Dramatic Velocipeding.

The velocipede has been successfully introduced by French dramatists into their plays, and it takes a prominent part in some of the more striking scenes. Had the divine " Villiams," as the French have dubbed the "noble bard," lived at the present day, he might have placed in the mouth of some hero desiring a speedy and safe means of locomotion, something indicative of the high estimate placed on the velocipede, after the style of " my kingdom for a horse.'' The dramatic situation in which Homer has placed Achilles, pursuing Hector around the walls of Troy would doubtless have been enhanced by the introduction of the velocipede, and an additional halo of romance would surround Ulysses could we imagine him velocipeding with Calypso in the deep seclusion of her wooded island home. The theatres here have caught the infection, and at the __Crosby Opera House__ in Chicago, the velocipede has been introduced, mounted by a young and fascinating lady, and her sylph-like evolutions have created such a sensation that there are always crowded audiences, instead of rows of empty seats and boxes.

__The Tammany.__ The enterprise of Messrs. Jarrett & Palmer has not suffered them to be behind the age, and a person engaged for the purpose, " turns and winds his fiery Pegasus,'' the velocipede, which modern Centaur is as wonderful to the awe-struck spectators as was the apparition of the Thessalonian horsemen to the country people of old, or that of the ancient Hippogriff, or of the original Centaurs as they fought on Othry's shaggy brow.

__The Grand Opera.__ It is rumored and believed that Tostee will, on her reappearance as the Grand Duchess come to camp mounted on a velocipede, and the fascinating and graceful Irma will give a new version of Blue Beard, and escape being poisoned by a timely flight on the velocipede.

__The French Theatre.__ It is not believed that the affable and enterprizing Mr. Grau will allow the rival Opera Bouffe Troupe to gallop away with all the laurels, leaving him in the lurch, and it is currently reported that he has undertaken himself personally the velocipede education of Miles. Rose Bell and Desclauzas, so we must prepare ourselves to see on the revival of Genevieve de Brabant, Rose Bell prancing and curvetting on the veloce, and Genevieve advising velocipede exercise to her noble spouse with a view of his more complete physical development, whereas, Drogan is supposed to be reaping the benefit of the advantages already attained from the frequent use of the machine.

__Niblo's.__ At this temple of Vestris, in case Miles. Sangalis and Bonfanti are re-engaged, they will be sure to perform a _pas Diabolique_, while the veloce is at full speed.

__Academy of Music.__ At this place there is no room left for doubt but that we may hear Brignoli, that zebra of tenors, managing the bicycle with that same grace and elegance which characterises all his movements, and which movements have caused him to be called the " tenor de grazia" par excellence of this country, much more than from the timbre of his voice. He can hardly be accepted as a model, however, for it is said that he recently repulsed the advances of a lovely blonde, who became enamored of his stage appearance, as he could not reconcile by any arguments intelligible to himself the anomaly of her having the Grecian bend, and still being in straitened circumstances. This has evoked the hostility of the friends of the injured young lady, and they chew the "bitter cud of revenge," by declaring base the tenor of his ways.

__The Worrell Sisters.__ May possibly take to the velocipede and add to their numerous accomplishments that of bicycle riding. As they are extremely lithe and graceful in all their movements, they could, with very little trouble learn to

> "Witch the world with noble horsemanship."

__Wallack's.__ It is said that the _engaging_ Mr. Moss will not consider any application for the position of walking lady, unless she gives proof positive that she can cry "terms of manage" to her bounding steed. At the

__Olympic__ Miss Moore, the champion _"skatist,"_ who is now astonishing the inhabitants of Cleveland by her performances on the velocipede on their skating ponds and theatres, will give a like exhibition in case of her re-entering into a contract with Mr. Fox.

__Bryant's minstrels.__ Will of course follow in the wake of the other places of amusement.

__Tony Pastor's__ "The young man from the country," as Tony has been playfully surnamed, will adopt the institution, and at the Bowery, Kelly & Leon's Apollo Hall, and at all other places of amusement we may expect speedily to see this instrument underlined.

# Velocipede Racing.

The leaders of the European turf at the present day, instead of watching their horses run under the whip and spur of weazen-faced and slim-legged jockeys, indulge in velocipede races, which are less cruel and more exciting, and as early as next spring we expect to see our Jeromes and Belmonts follow their illustrious example.

In the suburbs of Paris, Velocipede races are especially interesting. The village in 'which the race is to take place is always in holiday guise, banners flaunting gaily, and eagles and flower wreaths may be seen in every direction, and the mayor in his red, white and blue scarf, the emblem of his office, usually favors the races with his presence. The racing ground is marked out with a large cluster of banners flying at the starting place.

The riders wear jockey-caps and silk jackets, and at the moment of starting they are drawn up abreast. The fair sex mount their chairs, and wave their little hands and flourish their pocket-handkerchiefs, and laugh, and almost scream with delight as at the signal their favorites start off. Spite of the exertions of the gensdarmes the crowd closes in behind the charioteers who are soon lost to sight. After the lapse of a few minutes, however, distant shouts and cheers announce their return, and the crowd opens to allow of the passage of the victor, who, drenched in perspiration, and with his legs working up and down with equal regularity and greater speed than the piston of a steam engine, the safety-valve of which is fastened down, passes the winning post, amidst the applause and laughter of the crowd, who enjoy the sport more than they would the finest horse racing.

The average length of the courses are 1800 metres, nearly a mile and a furlong. At Enghein this distance was traversed in 4 minutes and 25 seconds by a Velocipede with two wheels and 6 minutes and 28 seconds by a three-wheeled Velocipede.

Greater speed was attained at St. Cloud, when the course of 2,400 metres, almost equivelent to a mile and a half, was traversed in 4 minutes and 50 seconds; whereas the final race at Vincennes over a level course of 3,600 hundred metres -- 20 yards short of two miles -- took 9 minutes and 10 seconds to accomplish. But at these races prizes are not given for speed alone ; they are also accorded to those who occupy the longest time in traversing a specified distance, a far more difficult proceeding than accomplishing a mile in a few minutes, because when going at a snail's pace, it is almost impossible to preserve the proper balance, and horse and rider are usually both capsized. In a contest of this character at Vincennes, over a course of some 160 yards in length, out of six experienced ameteurs who started, only one succeeded in reaching the goal.

There are match races for all distances from one mile to one hundred. A couple of amateurs, making a tour through a part of France, challenged each other as to which could perform the greatest distance within four and twenty hours. One went 8? miles, and then gave out, and the other 125 miles. Also a party of nine left Rouen in the morning and arrived in Paris in time for dinner the same evening, having traversed the distance of 85 miles at a rate of speed averaging between ten and eleven miles an hour. Adepts find no difficulty in accomplishing fifty miles within five hours, without alighting from their vehicles.

There are handicap races, weights for age races, and races at catch weights. Subjoined we give an account of pool selling, and summary of a race; also an account of the recent race at Bordeaux by young ladies, which has attracted so much attention throughout Europe.

### [LADIES.]

Bordeaux, 7th November, 1868.

_Editor of the Velocipedist:_

Dear Sir: --Having been present at the Velocipede races which took place on Sunday, the first of November, at the Park Bordolais, I herewith send you a full account of the races, hoping that you will insert the same in the first number of your paper. Race for Ladies, (Speed.) —Three prizes. First best, gold

watch ; second best, gold medal ; third prize, silver medal. The equipment of the ladies left but little to be desired. Three of them were coquettishly rigged as pages; the fourth in a red riding dress. At the start, Mile. Louise took the lead which she kept for a long time. At about fifty yards from the winning post, she was joined by Mile. Julie, who continued alongside of her for a moment, and by an almost superhuman effort pushed herself half a length ahead.

Yours, Respectfully,

Henri Melancort,

Velocipedist.

# The Velocipede in a Medical Point of View.

Velocipeding is considered in many respects superior to skating, horseback-riding, cricket, base ball, or even rowing. While skating is good exercise for the legs, horseback-riding for the chest, cricket and base ball and rowing for legs and arms, the benefit derived from exercising on a Velocipede is not local. It causes a general development of the entire body. It is not, as may appear at first sight, fine exercise for the legs only; the arms are the first to feel the effects of the exercise, for when propelling a well designed Velocipede, the pressure of the feet on the stirrups must be met by a corresponding pressure of the hands on the tiller, necessary to prevent the front wheel from turning. This pressure of the tiller against the hands, when the rider is in an upright position, with elbows well back and hands well separated, is extremely developing to the chest and lungs; in fact, the relative position of saddle, stirrups and tiller are recommended by Dr. James E. Learning, of this city, who devotes his time exclusively to the study of the more proper development of the chest and lungs. He considers a properly designed velocipede one of the best aids to this much desired improvement of the human body.

Besides the many and important hygienic advantages derived from this exercise, respiration is facilitated, and an erect position of the body and expanded chest result. The muscles of the back and shoulders are relieved from the injurious strain often imposed by habits of stooping.

Upon a properly and scientifically constructed machine, no position incompatible with the laws of health, or inconsistent with ease and elegance of motion can be maintained. The muscles of the arm and forearm are brought into healthful action, and those machines whose tiller or steering handles are curved, and brought well back, cause the rider to assume a proper and erect position with the arms and elbows parallel with the body. These are justly estimated, in a medical point of view, as well as assuring a graceful and elegant bearing with an easy and elastic carriage.

In the propulsion of the veloce the principle muscles brought into action, being the same as those used in walking, an increased development of the same must result. This point -- the application of the power -- merits the careful criticism of the medical profession, and especial attention of the velocipedist. Eeference is made to an improved stirrup or crank pin found upon the "American" machine manufactured in this city, in which the ball of the foot, instead of the shank, is made the medium for communication of the power. On the French machine so extensively copied and patterned in this country, the unfortunate use of the delicate and tender shank is encouraged instead of the strong and elastic ball of the foot. The shank of the foot was never intended to exert force or receive pressure, and we cannot but consider its use in this connection as not only unnatural, but ungraceful and improper. Under certain conditions positive injury results to the structural arrangement of this sensitive portion of the foot, from the undue pressure and labor imposed. Too much protection cannot be afforded the complex nerve filaments and capillary blood vessels composing this delicate structure. If room for doubt exists in the mind of any one, and a comparative trial of the shank versus the ball of the foot, as used in propulsion be desired, we would simply recommend the test with uncovered and unprotected feet.

The ankle, one of the most wonderful and intricate articulations of the skeleton, is brought into exercise by this improved method of propulsion and stirrup.

By using the ball of the foot, the cartilages and ligaments of the joints become so strengthened that the frequent and painful accident of sprained ankle is obviated, and dislocation of the same, a thing most rare.

Indeed, so many and important results are to be derived from this improved stirrup that its advantages over the French models must be obvious at first sight. It recommends itself as one of the most important improvements on the velocipede.

With fourteen years experience as a practitioner of the timehonored allopathic school, and with an unwavering steadfast adherence to her teachings and practice, and with genuine affection to our alma mater, we at last yield to the claims of the new and popular __Velocipathy__ and declare openly our conviction as regards this preparation of iron, (the veloce) the most excellent tonic and appetizer of our modern Pharmacopcea.

We consider its application especially indicated, and shall persevere in prescribing full doses with all due respect to R- (Jupiter help us) to each and every sufferer and convalescent from dyspepsia, hypochondria and melancholia in our practice, alike to the plethoric disciple of the Bantling system, in full dozes, as well as to the anemic and chloretic fair, in small.

With due regard and admiration for the skill and eminent success of the Metropolitan Board of Health ; their untiring energy and profound wisdom, as displayed in staying the ravages of pestilence that threatened our city the past summer, we would respectfully recommend to that honored body for future consideration, the velocipede as a hygienic expedient in "flying from infection," contagion being considered by the velocipedist impossible. 

S., Staten Island, January 25th, 1869.

# Henry Ward Beecher on the Velocipede.

A lecture was delivered by Henry Ward Beecher, in Plymouth Church, to a crowded audience, on the evening of the 27th inst., in which he expressed his opinions concerning the velocipede, from which we make the following extracts, which may be interesting to our readers:

The lecturer commenced by a lengthened dissertation on the couuteracing influences of society, and adverted to the fickle changes which characterized its organization, showing the consequences of extremes.

He proposed to unite mirth and morality, and who would forbid the banns. Amusement was the prerogative of those men whose business was not amusement. Life could not be economized without wholesome enjoyment, for'real amusement economized time and promoted industry. He showed the pernicious result of entirely occupying the mind with business without participating ocasionally in some rational amusement. The little dances in friendly circles, closing early,'were to be commended not only for harmlessness, but for their positive usefulness. He advocated as well as defended them, but the night routs and balls were to be condemned, for they sacrificed, the end which amusement seeks. The indelicacies and extravagances of those fashionable dissipations, which found men happy and left them wretched, which found men pure, and left them vitiated filled the mind with disgust ; for instance, a school boy after exhausting studies, should not play chess, for the brain was again brought into active requisition. Out door amusements would be a relief. The engineer, the merchant, the lawyer goes home, and finds unspeakable delight in the frolics of little children, yet such frolics would be but a poor relief to a nurse of a foundling hospital. For his own part he would like to run an express engine for an hour or two as a recreation. Now, it would occur, what were the amusements best calculated to promote wholesome enjoyment. Respecting the theatre, was it in e.ny sense an instructor? was it an educator of taste? was it an important element of public amusement. He wished not to attack or defend the theatre in moral respects.

But there were other kinds of amusements to which he wished to draw attention—namely, those which excited the mind, raised the animal spirits, and gave free play to the muscles. One of the great questions of the day, was in relation to the coming man, and how he was to come. He thought he was coming on a velocipede—(laughter)—a new machine that was bound to play a prominent part in the category of amusements, a toy to some, an instrument of great use to others. He had purchased two for his own boys, and there was every probability of his riding on one himself. He was not too old to learn, but he hoped that it would not be said that the velocipede was his hobby. His auditors were not too old to learn, and he would not be at all surprised to see in a short time hence a thousand velocipedists wheeling their machines to Plymouth Church. The lecturer next referred to the game of billiards, which he highly commended, but considered that considerable danger was attached to it owing to the evil communications of billiard saloons. He recommended the use of billiard tables in all associations organized for social enjoyment. Yachting was admirable, but owing to its peculiar nature commended itself to only a few, while the oar was democratic, and productive of good health and pleasure. Referring to walking, he thought American men did not walk half enough, and few knew the exhilarating effects of a good walk. The horse was a noble instrument of amusement, and he commended trials of speed and endurance, for it was easy for every animal to do that for which God specially made it. The road was truly the domain of the true horse. He was, however, opposed to the turf, not because it wasted time, or tried the utmost speed of fast horses, but simply because of its gambling, for the bet was the marrow of the race. Moreover, all attempts at reformation were hopeless, and those pleading the reformation were only playing a sharper game. The reverend gentleman concluded by hoping that all Young Men's Associations —hitherto nothing more than mere churches—would be thrown open for the wholesome amusement of youth, and he felt satisfied that the result would be most beneficial. Throughout the lecturer was frequently interrupted with applause.

__INTERESTING NEWS ABOUT THE VELOCIPEDE THERE IS AN AMERICAN PATENT FOR IT.__


Much excitement has been created during the past week among the velocipede manufacturers throughout the country, most of whom have received the following

> "You are hereby notified that letters patent, No. 59,915, granted Nov. 20, 1866, secures a velocipede with the two wheels, treadles, and guiding-arms, and that the velocipede you are manufacturing is an infringement upon the said patent. The present is to require you to cease the further manufacture of said velocipede, and to settle with me for all past infringements of the rights under said patent.

> (Signed) "Caivin Witty."

Upon searching the Patent Records, we find the following:

> "Patent No. 59,915. Pierre Lallement, Paris, France, assignor to himself and James Carroll, New Haven, Conn. Velocipede. Nov. 20, 1866. The fore wheel is axled in the jaws of a depending bar, which is pivoted in the frame and turned by a horizontal lever bar. This wheel is revolved by a treadle-crank. Claim: The combination and arrangement of the two wheels, provided with the treadles and the guiding arms, so as to operate substantially as and for the purpose herein set forth."

Mr. Witty claims to have purchased the patent above described, and states that he is prepared to sustain it. Should he be able to make his claim valid in law, he is a lucky man but we imagine that he will find serious difficulties in his way.

We learn that some of the Newark firms engaged in makingvelocipedes, and one or two of the New York firms, have concluded to suspend operations until the validity and ownership of the claim are established, or the contrary. Other makers declare their readiness and ability to contest the patent; while Messrs. Pickering & Davis, of this city, have already made arrangements to continue the manufacture under this patent, if sustained, and we understand that some other prominent makers also intend a similar arrangement.
