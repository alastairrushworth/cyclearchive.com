# History of the Velocipede.

In our last (which was our first) we gave a general outline of the History of the Velocipede, culled from several reliable authorities. But as we have received numerous inquiries in reference to a more detailed account, we present this month items of additional interest, together with engravings, for most of which we are indebted to the Scientific American, of this city, while to that go-ahead little journal, The Sun, whose manager is one of the best velocipede experts this city can boast, we are also indebted for many "sunbeams."

A velocipede invented by Baron Drais, and improved by Lewis Gompertz, of Surrey, in England, with an engraving and description of the same, extracted from the 39th volume of the Repertory of Arts, published in 1821, is herewith presented to our readers. It will be seen that it has many features in common with the ones now in vogue, but the method of propelling it is quite different.

![](/images/the-velocipedist/1869-2/_page_0_Picture_7.jpeg)

The object of the improvement of Gompertz was to bring the arms of the rider into action, in assistance to his legs. It consisted in the application of a handle, C, which is to be worked backwards and forwards, to which is attached a circular rack, D G, which works in a pinion, E, with ratch wheel on the front wheel of the velocipede, and which, on being pnlled by the rider with both hands, sends the machine forward, and when thrust from him does not send it back again, on account of the ratch which allows the pinion to turn in that direction free of the wheel. H is the saddle, and the rest, B, is so made that the breast of the rider bears against it, while the sides come around him at some distance below the arms, and is stuffed. The 'rider could, with this machine, either propel it entirely without the feet, or he could use the feet while the arms were free. The beam, A, was made of beech wood, and a pivot at, F, allowed the front wheel to be turned to the right or left at the will of the rider. This must have been, although somewhat clumsily shaped, a quite efficient machine, good for the times—forty-eight years ago.

Very much has been said, and many brains have been at work, devising one wheeled veloces. We present an engraving of an English invention. We think it would be as easy to keep upright upon such a wheel as it is to sit on a chair balanced upon two legs, resting upon the rather uncertain substratum of a slack rope. 

![](/images/the-velocipedist/1869-2/_page_0_Picture_10.jpeg)

The engraving needs little explanation. The feet are placed on short stilts connected with the cranks, one on either side of the rim, while the rider sits upon a steel spring saddle over the centre of the whole wheel. The inventor modestly limits the diameter of the wheel to twelve feet, and the number of revolutions at fifty per minute. Twenty-five miles per hour is the speed expected to be reached.

We also give an engraving of a steam velocipede.  

![](/images/the-velocipedist/1869-2/_page_0_Picture_12.jpeg)

The cylinders and their attachments to the two driving wheels are not shown.  They are placed vertically in front of the boiler, between it and the seat, and connect with cranks on the shaft of the driving wheels. The engraving shows the position of the boiler relatively to the other parts of the machine. The engine is a direct-acting compound engine of 2 cylinders, each cylinder 2 1/2 inches diameter, and 5 inches stroke. The steering gear consists of an endless chain over a grooved wheel on the engine shaft, and passing over a corresponding wheel fixed between the forked shaft just over the front wheel. The latter grooved wheel is a wide one, and over it passes another chain. This latter chain works round the boss of the front wheel. This arrangement gives power to the front wheel, so that in turning a corner, this wheel takes a wider sweep than the two driving-wheels, which go first. In traveling on a straight road (backwards) the machine is turned to either side by turning the steering wheel to the opposite side. The boiler is a vertical one, with four tubes 1 Jin. internal diameter, hanging down by the side of the fire-box. The fire-grate is cast with four holes in it to receive the bottom ends of the tubes, so as to hold them firmly. Height of boiler, 2ft. 6in. ; height of fire-box, 15in.; diameter of fire-box, llin. ; diameter of boiler, 14in. The fire-box and tubes are copper, pressure 2001bs.; but 25 lbs of steam will be equal to a velocipede propelled by the feet. Great speed is expected from this velocipede.

We must of course present an engraving, taken from the Patent Office Reports, showing the Lallement improvement of 1866.

![](/images/the-velocipedist/1869-2/_page_1_Picture_2.jpeg)

In this veloce the cranks, F, are points of great interest, as the claim is for the combination of these treadle cranks with the two wheels A and B, reach C guiding arms D, and the fork in which the front wheel is hung. We attribute the unpopularity of the old dandy-horse to its lack of these cranks, while the great success of the modern Veloce is due to the crank application. In this veloce it will be noticed that the reach, C, extends over the hind wheel, and a V brace on each side of the wheel connects the axle to the reach. With this style of reach or frame it was found very difficult to construct a veloce sufficiently steady to run with any degree of satisfaction. In 1867 the Hanlon Bros, devised an improved style of reach, consisting of a bifurcated bar, or fork, in the jaws of which the hind wheel is allowed to re- ' volve, while the single end of this fork forms part of the swivel over the front wheel. Not yet satisfied with this veloce, on account of the difficulty they found in using the same machine for their in-door performances and out-door exhibitions, they had the saddle arranged so as to be enabled to vary its position nearer to or farther from the front wheel, and at the same time had slots made in the cranks, so that the treadles might be adjusted to various lengths. These alterations were found to be of such benefit that application for a patent covering these improvements was made by them and granted by the Patent Office. We know of no velocipedes now being made in this country which do not include in their construction all these late improvements, and the Hanlon's are now notifying manufacturers of the existence of their claims, for which, it is to be hoped, they will not charge as much as Mr. Witty does for his, as the additional royalty of ten dollars would exercise a corresponding increase in the prices of velocipedes which would be very unpopular. In fact many manufacturers consider the royalty charged by Mr. Witty too high, and some of them say that they do not feel like paying it until the question of its validly will have been settled legally.

# Velocipedes for Ladies.

The question of the day has finally been decided. American ladies are to velocipede. Up to this time it was a matter of doubt as to whether the ladies would take to the velocipede or not, as many had supposed that the use of the bicycle was of course out of the question unless each fair rider followed Jessica's example, and obscured herself in the lovely garnish of a boy. But while the young men, and some that alas! are young no longer, are dashing about on velocipedes, the active young women look on with envy and emulation. They do not see why they should be denied the exercise and amusement which the bicycle so abundantly furnishes. Many tricycles have been designed for their especial use, but with those they are not satisfied, and this style of veloce will not come into general use. The ladies want a little of the risk and dash which attends the riding of the two-wheeled veloce, and will hardly be content with a machine that cannot possibly upset or run into somebody.

The idea is sometimes conceived, from seeing experts ride side-saddle fashion and drive the machine with one foot, that ladies might begin by learning that mode of velocipeditation, but it is a mistake. It would be well nigh impossible to acquire the art in that way, though it is easy enough after one has learned. What is needed is a two-wheeled veloce properly adapted to the use of ladies, and we present an engraving of one now at the Hanlon Bro's Hall, Broadway, which has been closely examined by many experts and pronounced quite satisfactory. It will be seen that the reach or frame, instead of forming a nearly straight line from the front swivel to the hind axle, follows the curve of the front wheel until it reaches aline nearly as low as the hind axle, when it runs horizontally to that point of the hind wheel. The two wheels being separated three or four inches, allow of an upright rod being secured to the reach; around this is a spiral spring, on which a comfortable cane-seated willow-backed chair is placed. This machine, with a moderate sized wheel (say thirty to thirty-three inches), will permit a lady to drive with a great deal of comfort and all the advantages of the two-wheel veloce, without its objectionable features. For instance, in mounting, a lady would have to step over the reach at a point only twelve inches from the floor—the height of an ordinary step in a flight of stairs. And, now, as to the dress. What is wanted in this respect is a dress that shall be suitable for either riding or walking. This, we think, has also been achieved, and that by a lady, as was also the veloce we have illustrated. Let us try to describe the dress for a _velocipedestrienne_. Let the outer dress skirt be made so as to button its entire length in front—the back part should be made to button from the bottom to a point about three-eighths of a yard up the skirt. This arrangement does not detract at all from the appearance of an ordinary walking costume. When the wearer wishes to prepare for a drive, she simply loosens two or three of the lower buttons at the front and back, and bringing together the two ends of each side, separately, buttons them in this way around each ankle. This gives a full skirt around each ankle, and, when mounted, the dress falls gracefully at each side of the front wheel. A club of six young ladies have taken this veloce and costume under their special care, and declare that if it is not sufficiently perfect, they will soon make it so, as they are bound to be prepared for the Park the coming Summer ; they practice regularly every morning, and are even now good riders. What they want is more machines, which are being made, and Spring time, which is coming.

# Interesting to Purchasers.

We clip the following from the _Sun_, which, by the way, throws many _"rays of light"_ on the subject of velocipeding just now. Its manager is well posted, and knows whereof he affirms

"The complaint of the high price of velocipedes is not well founded. The profits of the makers are not extravagant, and as long as materials and labor are as dear as now the cost cannot be much reduced.

There is no other kind of vehicle which receives severer usage than the velocipede. The weight of the rider and the concussions of the road are not only borne by two wheels only, but the necessity of giving the fore wheel a sidewise motion renders it indispensable to connect the two by a frame whose peculiar form and character make it exceedingly liable to be deranged and broken. This frame and its appendages must be of wrought iron, steel, and brass, and all the work upon it must be of the very best quality, or else the machine will soon get out of order and become useless. The fittings of the two wheels, their axles and their journals, must also be of first-rate workmanship. The same is true of the wheels themselves. No wood that is not perfectly seasoned should be used for them ; and the hubs, spokes, and felloes should be built with the utmost care and thoroughness. Otherwise they will soon become wobbling and unsteady, so that speed and comfort will be out of the question.

"No doubt it is now possible to buy cheap velocipedes, and they may be made cheaper yet perhaps, but the best are none too good. For instance, we know of makers whose wheels cost, unfinished, only three dollars a pair, while others pay for theirs four dollars apiece ; but for use the dear ones are worth more than the difference. The price of a first-rate machine cannot fall much below a hundred dollars until there is a general decline in the price of all sorts of commodities."


# Correspondence.

(From our Special Correspondent.)
Chicago, February 25, 1869. 

_To the Editor of the Velocipedist, N. Y._

__Dear Sir__: The velocipede fever in Chicago as well as elsewhere, is attaining a remarkable height. It forms no small part of the conversation of our young and muscular men, who look upon the new invention as another source of excitement; while very many of our staid business citizens, "with no dem'd nonsense about them," as Mr. Sparkler would say, are seriously investigating its merits and initiating themselves into a mastery of this newmethod of travelling between their homes and their offices in quick time, and at no expense after the animal is purchased. Two riding schools have already been established for instruction, and their books show a list of some one hundred pupils. The first was opened by Messrs. Duryea and Pearsall, in Garrett Block, No. 79 State Street, in a large hall—which, however, is intended only to be used until a better one can be found—and attracts many visitors in addition to the regular pupils. Pearsall Brothers, of New York, the originators of velocipede riding schools, are connected with this firm. The gentlemen here are agents for the different varieties of the machine.

The other school is that of Mr. Miles, in Zouave Hall, corner of State and Adams Streets. He is also very successful in his enterprise, the hall being frequented day and evening. The charge for tuition at each school is $15 for two weeks or less, including use of machine. A much less time, however, is generally sufficient to make a person proficient in riding, three or four lessons often sufficing to give the necessary confidence, so that the beginner can go on with his practice without aid.

The schools are open from 9 A. M. to 9 P. M., and are very entertaining places of resort, the varied tumblings, collisions, and other involuntary exercises of the learner being very amusing to the spectator. Nobody gets hurt, however, and although it may be a little embarrassing to a modest man to make his first essay before an unsympathizing crowd, he soon gets over that in the exhilaration of the exercise. There are some six or eight machines in use at each hall, which are as many as can be well used at a time, but as the schools are open all day a large number of pupils can find opportunity to practice as much as they desire.

Mr. Brainard, of 187 State street, the agent for the celebrated "Pickering" velocipede, has disposed of quite a number of them, and states that the demand is far in advance of the supply. He has calls for them from places as far distant as Omaha.

Of the utility of the velocipede as a means of rapid conveyance, there seems to be no doubt. It has passed the period of being considered a mere toy, and although when the novelty wears off, some may not be as enthusiastic as now, it will still continue to be used, and in an increasing degree, for street locomotion.

The fair sex have the mania, but in their case, like consumption, it is incurable. There are a thousand reasons why it is a misfortune to be a woman, but just now, the chief of all of them is, she can't straddle a velocipede. Like shaving, the machine is an exclusively masculine appurtenance.

One difficulty with the velocipede is, that a good many young men, owing to the thinness of their legs, cannot impel them. Ayoung man out near me, has overcome this difficulty by hiring a colored man to push him. By this means he saves his legs, and makes pretty good time.

I tried one the other day. It is a balky kind of steed. To get 'on is not difficult. To stay on is a labor of genius. I stayed on about three-fifths of one second. It first got me off by lying down on one side. The next time it unhorsed me by lying down on the other. Then it ran away, and threw me through a picket-fence, carrying off four pickets in the operation. Then it ran away again, and shied me off into the gutter. Next, it stuck fast in a crack in the side-walk, pitching me over its head. Then it backed violently down a small hill, throwing me over its tail.

The following are among the results: two tired feet, two tired arms, triumphant faith, many sore trials, many soL'e muscles, plenty of ideas, a hundred unexpected and incalculable twists, two falls, and a determination and expectation to master the gig in two more days.

I am so confident of it that I hereby challenge any velocipedist in Chicago to a steeple-chase from the court-house, through the tunnel, around on Madison Street Bridge, and down the side-walk to the post-office — each contestant to ride his own velocipede, and the winner to be entitled to a leather medal, which shall be presented to him on some benefit night, on the stage of Aiken's new theatre.

Experience enables me to offer the following rules for the riding and managing of the velocipede

A velocipede can't be made fat by feeding it with oats or cut straw.

The natural gait of a velocipede is a roll, and it can't be broke to trot or canter.

Riding a velocipede bare-backed and circus fashion, that is, standing on one foot and sticking the other straight out, can't be done with safety.

Spurs or riding whips are unnecessary.

A velocipede about eight hands high, sound in wind, and limb, and well broken under the saddle, is the most desirable.

_Earnest Travers de Vere._

# The Velocipede in a Medical Point of View.

(By a leading Medical Practitioner.) The great cry of late years has seen physical degeneration. We would ask, in what part of man's structure does it occur? Not in beauty of form ; not in personal prowess; not in the mean duration of life; not in civilization; but in its vices, as alcohol, opium, tobacco, and in conditions depending upon that state.

So far as our observation goes, the condition of civilization does not appear to weaken bodily vigor, provided the locomotive system is kept in activity that is, if the masses had the necessary amount of exercise in the open air, with a perfect exercise of every muscle in the body.

A neglect of the powers with which our creator has endowed us, is punished by their withdrawal. Let the intellect remain idle year by year, it will become sluggish and wanting in power. Tie up an arm for months and it withers away. Let the muscles of our clerks, or shop men, or indolent young ladies remain idle, they will degenerate and take on atrophy.

All parts of the human organism, not sufficiently worked, are liable to degenerate ; if there is no demand made upon any tissue, there is no supply the nerve force which should guide and govern is let sleep ; no new store is laid in or taken up, and the whole muscular system degenerates into inelastic fibre of low vitality. Muscles affected with atrophy are soft, friable, and undergo premature decay; whereas, a moderate amount of exercise, a natural use of every part of the body, leaves our frames well proportioned.

Atrophy, from _non use_ of certain muscles of the body, is the great cause of physical degeneration, its peculiar and typical appearance is indubitable, and stamps upon its possessor the impress of sure destruction.

Everything that prolongs human life, ameliorates human suffering, elevates and developes the human frame, is an element of progress, an element that all true men admire and cherish.

Every conceivable form of amusement and exercise have been tried to aid the rising generation in overcoming this process of destruction ; some are good, others bad, as an example, the use of base ball predisposes to disease of the heart.

The exercise derived by the new American velocipede is free from every kind of objection—being a natural exercise of every muscle of the body, and, therefore, an invaluable means of promoting health. It is constructed purely on physiological principles ; has two wheels, one before the other the seat between. The instrument is brass and iron, strongly made but light. Pedals receive the feet, one on each side, and by these the motion is chiefly communicated. The movement of the feet is precisely the same as in walking. A handle in front serves to aid the rider in turning.

We look upon this mode of exercise with this physiologically constructed machine, as one of the most brilliant discoveries of the nineteenth century the grand desideratum that will emancipate our youth from muscular lethargy and atrophy that is so common.

The Velocipede in Japan.— A correspondent of the _Scientific American_ writing from Yokohama, Japan says: "a gentlemen, well known in this settlement, lately took a trip to Yeddo, on a velocipede; and returned in safety, meeting with no annoyance on the way. Rumor says that many persons have sent home for these locomotives, and that some are on their way out."

__Answers to Correspondents.__ Questions relative to velocipeding, or kindred subjects, appropriate for answer in this journal, are invited, and will receive careful attention.

# Racing.

Although many races have taken place throughout the country, of all of which we would like to give our readers full and detailed particulars, still our limited space obliges us to forego this pleasure ; we, however, subjoin accounts and summaries of two :

__Velocipede Race at New Bedford.__ The proprietors of the Temperance Hall Rink offered a silver cup to the person who should make a quarter of a mile in the shortest time. The distance was measured by a rope nailed down on the floor in a circle, and the racers had to make a certain number of turns outside of it. The spectators were very numerous, including many ladies. The time made by the contestants was as follows : —William Wood, 1 minute 40 seconds ; George Covell, 1.56 ; A. Craige, Jr., 1.42 ; Daniel V. Kearn 1.53 ; John Macauley, ruled out for running across the rope ; Willie Parlow, 1.43J ; William W. Allen, 1.40 ; William G. Lamb, 1.48. There being a tie between William Wood and William W. Allen, they got the word to o-o again, when the time was 1.39 for Wood, and 1.37 for Allen, and the cup was awarded to the latter.

__The First Velocipede-Race in New Jersey.__ The first of a series of velocipede-races took place in the Grand street Velocipede Hall, in Jersey City, recently. The proprietors, Richmond & Co., offered a silver cup to such one of their pupils as should beat his competitors in a race on the bicycle around the hall eight times, a distance of a quarter of a mile. Early in the evening the hall, which was formerly a Catholic chapel, was crowded with spectators, and at about half-past 8, the judges, Messrs. T. W. Burger, M. Hio-ginbotham, and Recorder Martindale, took their places on the platform (once the chancel). The Recorder recited the conditions of the race to the boys, and everything was ready, when in turn the following named velocipedists made the time set opposite-their names respectively:

| E. Jones | 1:32 1/2| R.Rogers | 1:25 1/2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E.Horton | 1:25 | R. Cooper, withdrawn. |  |
| George Peters | 1:49 3/4 | John Black | 1:38 |
| FrankKnower | 1:47 | F. Ockernausen | 2:04 1/4 |
| E. S.Seymour | 1:36 1/2| Chas. E. Fisher | 1:32 |
| Geo. Austin | 1:39 |  |  |

At this point the judges told Horton that they believed that they had made a mistake, and that he had gone only seven times around; Horton tried again, and made 1:30J ; whereupon the cup was awarded to Rogers. The entertainment was concluded with an exhibition of skating on rollers, by the accomplished skater, John Englis.

---

__Grand Velocipede Race in Brooklyn.__ The managers of the Prospect Park Association have made arrangements to signalize their first Spring meeting for 1869 with a grand velocipede-tournament, at which prizes amounting to $1,500 will be given for the best time to the winners in a series of races on velocipedes. A code of rules will be drawn up governing the entries, by which the different contestants will be handicapped according to the weight of riders and machines, diameter of driving-wheels, extent of treadles, etc. There will be first, second and third prizes for speed, and first and second prizes for length of time, or slow riding. The list of entries is open to all riders, and it is expected that the display of skill will surpass anything yet seen in this country.

As an immense amount of practice is necessary to train for mile-heats on velocipedes, those who intend to enter should commence training as soon as possible. The roads leading to the grounds of the Association, on the way to Bath, will soon be in condition, and the course itself will no doubt be open to riders connected with the association, or to those about to enter the lists. The prizes will no doubt attract the best riders of the country ; and it is anticipated that the time of the fastest trotting-horses will be made. The excitement attendant upon this grand velocipede-race will be immense, and it, is anticipated that 20,000 people will visit the grounds on the occasion.

# Schools.

The Pearsall Riding Academy, Broadway and 22d Street, which has the credit of being the pioneer school in this country, has become so over-crowded that the _Brothers_ have found it necessary to open other rooms at the junction of Broadway, 7th Avenue and 47th Street. In addition to their schools in this city they have also branch schools, one in Detroit and one in Chicago, both of which are in full operation. Their books show a list of over 400 members, and they have turned out a large number of _go it gracefuls_ and several who now belong to the _fancy few_. Their evening entertainments are very interesting, and their rooms generally crowded. An interesting feature in their Broadway room is an artificial hill, twenty feet from base to summit, with a rise of _one_ foot in _three_; its ascent is easily accomplished by many of the experts. The Brothers have also opened, under their Broadway school, a store for the sale of velocipedes, where persons may select from the various styles and qualities a _household pet_ to suit their taste and purse.

The opening of a new shool at Hartford, Conn., war celebrated on the evening of the 24th, by an exhibition in the new Opera House, of which, by the way, the city may be proud. The exhibition opened with a contest between amateurs for a gold medal, to be worn by the winner six months, at the end of which time it is to be open for competition. There were several entries by "local celebrities," and F. R. Olmsted was awarded the prize, having made th'e circuit of the hall fifteen times in 1:58, Master Collins doing it in 1:56 ; but speed and grace governing the award, the difference in time was allowed in favor of Olmsted.

The Hanlon Bro's Quartette Club, consisting of Messrs. Brady, Foote, and the Pickering Bro's, of New York, showed what experts can do, by various turnings and twistings, side-saddle movements, and so forth, making the entertainment one of many attractions. The only accident which occurred was made by a slip of "Hen" Bullock, whose bicycle velocipeded him over the platform into the parquette, but he came up all right, and the crowd rather enjoyed the incident. The exhibition was got up under the direction of Timothy Drake and E. W. Bliss, who opened a school in the basement of the Opera House the next afternoon.

There is a school for teaching ladies the velocipede in this city, but it is kept very private.

# Advice to Velocipedists.

As we expect the day is not far distant when velocipedes will be as numerous in the Park

> "as Soland Geese In the islands of the Orcades."

And, as much tribulation is likely to follow the first attempts at controlling and directing the machine, it behooves the would-be expert to ponder upon the Etiquette Code, which follows:

Advice, it is said, comes most naturally from those who have followed it, most easily from those who have not,

The advice in this case comes both naturally and easily. Remember what is most needed is confidence, that quality which, like a blush, is least seen in those who have most occasion for it. But, on the other hand, don't be rash, for confidence is like all those other ardent spirits of which a little more than a little is by much too much, and if allowed to override your judgment may lead you into trouble.

It is no disgrace to upset a veloce. _"On peut ètre honète homme et faire mal des vers,"_ says Moliere. Should your bones happen in any of your falls to come in too sudden contact with the ground, rub the bruised part with the skin of a seal calf, Ciesar's preventive against lightning. When taking your first lessons, always take one of these with you, or else provide yourself with a bottle of liniment, which is equally as efficacious, and not as expensive as the other remedy. When yon have learned to ride, follow the example of the earlier meerschaum smokers, and let your acquaintances know that you have accomplished the end of your existence.

Unless you are perfectly at home in the saddle, don't attempt to raise your hat in saluting the fair friends you may meet, but give them the dignified yet graceful nod of the man upon whose shoulders rest the responsibilities of an empire. If you have not graduated with all the honors, do not watch an awkward rider, for if you do, you will unconsciously imitate his manner of straddling the beam, of crooking your back, and dodging invisible and imaginary day bats. When you alight at Delmonico's or elsewhere, and employ a ragged little boy to hold your steed, make a study of that boy's countenance, take a mental photograph of that boy, for you may need it in recovering your movable property. When you reward him for his services give him cash, and not compliments, for with a slight difference in the form of address he might say to you, as poverty-stricken Sorbiere said to Pope Clement under similar circumstances, "Holy Father, you give ruffles to a man who is in want of a shirt." If you can be accommodated with a friend's veloce, don't buy. Valesius used to say that he learned more from borrowed books than from his own, because not having them with him always, he read them more attentively. 'Tis ever thus with pleasures that cost nothing. Borrowing may dull the edge of husbandry, but it sharpens one's talent for bicycle driving, and makes the enjoyment of the sport as keen as Tom Hood's sense of the ludicrous.

# Velocipedisms.

-- A Springfield clergyman has become a velocipedist.

-- There was a considerable rage for velocipedes in England thirty years ago, and among those who distinguished themselves as velocipedists was Michael Faraday, the chemist, who frequently drove his machine through the suburbs of London.

-- In the streets of Boston they drive their velocipedes so fast that, as the _Sunday Times_ says, every collision results in the total disappearance of both riders and machines. No fragments are ever found.

-- It is proposed by Mr. Pickering, the velocipede maker, to obviate railway accidents by sending a man on a velocipede ahead of every train to give warning of any danger that he may discover on the track. _N. Y. Sun._

-- Velocipedes, we are assured by the _Shanghai News Letter_, have ceased to be a novelty in the streets of that city, and even the untaught Chinese ponies have become so used to them that they are no longer frightened.

-- One firm in Cincinnati is said to be making 1,600 velocipedes. They sell for $35 dollars apiece, and are dear at that.

-- Rumor whispers that the talented and accomplished "King of Scales," Eugene Trastour, is going to devote his time exclusively to the publication of velocipede music.

-- A mischevious girl living in Thirty-fourth street, being bothered by a number of lovers, has incited them to a public velocipede race—the winner to win her.

-- Velocipedists are classified according to their skill—the "timid toddlers," the "wary wabblers, " the "go-it-gracefuls, " and the "fancy few."

-- Velocipedists have encroached so greatly upon the privileges of pedestrians in Lyons, France, that the Mayor has issued a proclamation compelling the former to attach lanterns to their machines at night, and to keep the middle of the street.

-- Velocipede candy is now sold. The manufacturer finds it necessary to give notice that it is not worked by the feet.

-- The _Revolution_, in a very able article, advocates the use of the bicycle for ladies.

-- The shipment of velocipedes from this country, to England has commenced; the Inman steamer of Saturday last took a "Pickering" machine, which is to be followed by others as soon as completed.

-- An expert suggests, in the _Evening Post_, that-—"Before purchasing any machine, but particularly the cheaper ones, examine them closely yourself, or if not a judge of good mechanical workmanship, ask a friend to do it for you. Many defects are concealed by the coatings of paint, particularly in the castings and forgings : and a machine that is weak in any point is a dangerous one to use in fast riding. Be sure that every bolt is properly secured by nuts that cannot be shaken off ; they should be riveted on to the bolt, for they "will soon work loose if not so fastened. The crank should never be keyed on to the shaft, but fastened on to a square head." Very good advice, except the "square-headed" crank. We have tried several methods, and find that when proper care is exercised, a crank which is shrunk on to its shaft, will never trouble its owner.

-- On Saturday night Burnham's Velocipede Academy, in Brooklyn, was crowded with a highly respectable assemblage of spectators, among whom were a number of ladies, the occasion being a benefit to Mr. Burnham's popular assistant. A very attractive programme was prepared, and as it was a volunteer affair, quite a number of amateur experts took part in the displav, the exhibition of graceful and skillful riding equalling the best displays of the kind we have yet had in this country. The programme was commenced with the entree of thirteen riders on the principal machines of the metropolitan makers, including Wood's, Monod's, Pickering's, and one of Witty's latest machines. This was followed by some fancy riding, in which Mr. Carlton—the best amateur rider in Burnham's school—specially distinguished himself by his graceful and skillful movements on the machine. Next came eleven machines one after another, young Dunkee—a modest boy of Bumham's class—acting as leader. After which Messrs. Monod and Mercer exhibited some fancy riding, including most of the movements seen at our New York academies. This was followed by an exhibition of the "Dexter" machine, and some splendid riding by Messrs. Pickering, Foote and Professor Brady, in which the elder Pickering bore off the palm. This was succeeded by a display of riding with arms folded, in which Messrs. Carlton and Southwick took the lead. The feature of the evening, however, was the daringfeats of balancing, performed by Messrs. Robert Witty and Havel, in which all kinds of almost impossible feats were performed by the two riders, while both were on one machine, and one, too, which had been in daily use for months. The whole entertainment was an eminent success, and a display of graceful and daring riding, very creditable to the participants. New York will have to look to her laurels in velocipede riding, for the Brooklyn velocipedists are after her best riders with a sharp stick. The next entertainment in Brooklyn will be the ladies' reception at Burnham's, which is to be a private invitation affair, given by the subscribers at Burnham's school to their lady friends.-_Herald_

__Company K.__ 37th Regt. N. G. S. of N. Y., Capt. Richard H. Pascall, will hold its third annual reception at the armory, Broadway, 6th Avenue and 35th Street, on the evening of the 4th of March. On this occasion the members will for the first time wear the newly adopted uniform. Several members of this company are expert velocipedists, and contemplate company movements on the bicycle at an early date.

__Miscellaneous.__ The bicycle votaries are allowed the same privileges in the Prospect Pack, Brooklyn, as equestrians are, and ultimately they will, no doubt, be admitted to the extensive drives of the Park. The use of Washington Park, bounded by De Ivalb and Myrtle avenues, and Cumberland, Canton, and Raymond streets, is also placed at their disposal. On the corner of the Park fronting Myrtle avenue and Canton street, there is a wide, level plaza paved with the concrete surface, which is especially adapted for velocipede-riding. Besides which, there will be the wide walks around the Park, all of which will be at the command of velocipedists as soon as finished. The central location of Washington Park will lead to its being the fashionable resort of bicycle riders, and some fine riding will be seen on the plaza as soon as the snow is off.

As Bedford avenue, in Brooklyn, for over a mile in length, is going to be paved with the Scrimshaw concrete pavement, which gives a capital surface for velocipede-riding, that avenue, this Summer, will be a great resort for bicycles. The course will be from the junction of the avenue at Fourth street, Williamsburgh, to Pulton avenue, and within a block of the velocipede-depot, on the Capitoline grounds. A smooth-paved roadway is to be prepared along Clove road, which begins at the terminus of Bedford avenue, and thus will lead to the rear entrances of Prospect Park. Clinton street Brooklyn, is paved with the Nicholson block from its junction with Fulton to Union street ; and Union street is to be similarly paved all the way to the Park. This course is already a great resort for velocipedists every fine afternoon and evening.

The Central Park Commissioners only allow velocipedes on the walks and bridle paths, and, if anything, they are more in the way here than on the driving roads. In the Parisian parks the bicycle riders are obliged to keep to the drives. It is very evident that our Park Commissioners are behind the age in regard to velocipedes. They had better wake up at once, or otherwise the army of velocipedists will get np an indignation-meeting on the subject.

__"The Velocipedist."__ The _Sun's_ occupation is gone. The velocipedists have now a paper of their own, title, subject matter, advertisements and all __"The Velocipedist"__ is its title, and its pages are eight, and its paper is tinted. It looks well. So far as we have dipped into it, it reads well, telling all about bicycles, tricycles, and every other kind of cycles. "The object this paper has in view is to record everything of interest in the velocipede world." So say the editors, who are T. B. Pickering and W. Chester King. The Velocipedist is to be published monthly—terms, one dollar per annum. New York city is the base of publication. Long may it "rip." --_Newark Evening Courier._

__Chicago__ is fast in more respects than one, and is of course not behind in velocipeding. It is, in fact, one step ahead of time himself, if we may believe what one of its journals says:

"The grand feature of this Chicago velocipede is, that it is worked by spring power, and that the springs can be perpetually wound up by simply using the treadles alternately. _It only takes one-fourth the power to wind the springs that the springs exert in unwinding._ By pressing upon the treadle with the foot the ratchet is turned, on which is placed the spring, which of course is thereby wound."

Now, if power equal to 40 lbs. will propel this western improvement, a pressure equal to 10 lbs. only is required of the rider. Now, we would reccommend this inventor to just increase the power of his present spring onefourth above what it now has; by doing this he will be enabled to let the spring itself give the 10 lbs. initial pressure, and the three-fourths which comes from the peculiar construction of this peculiar spring itself will propel the velocipede without any exertion whatever from the rider. Having done this, let him then dispense with the cranks, and he will have achieved what millions of money has never yet been enabled to produce, viz: a mechanism which shall contain within itself its motive power—or, in other words, perpetual motion.

__Velocipede Reception and Hop.__ Though the velocipede has not yet engendered in our city the active febrile symptoms marking its introduction into the gay French capital, it is steadily and surely becoming here an institution. It is only a question of time, only a question of public familiarity with this curious modern bicycle possessing so many intrinsic elements of popularity, ease and safety of locomotion, combined with a dash of venturesomeness and exciting movement so specially captivating and in such marked unison with the go-ahead spirit of the age generally and of our" metropolitan city particularly. An opportunity to see the practice of this facinating art as well as healthful exercise in perfection was given Friday evening, February 12, at the Hanlou Brother's Velocipede Hall, Nos. 786 and 788 Broadway. The occasion was a reception and hop given by the members of the school to their friends. First, there was a large attendance—a most pleasant preliminary feature. For something over an hour the capacious hall resounded with the roll of velocipedes, often a dozen or more being ridden simultaneously. Everybody knows all about the bewildering mazes of the dance and sinuosities of skating. The movements of these velocipedes under the guidance of their expert riders, turning corners with the rapidity almost of thought, and in their interlacing courses describing every imaginable curve known in mathematics, were tenfold more astonishing. Mr. Frederick Hanlon, the champion rider, went through some of his astonishing feats, now whirling along at lightning speed, now with the feet alone going a ten mile gait, now dashing up an inclined plane of forty-five deg., and then going down with the utmost ease a declining plane of twenty-five deg., now vaulting on and off his velocipede, and now catching chairs thrown at him and holding them in his hands, still riding on. Professor Abner S. Brady evinced a like degree of skill, riding his velocipede with every assurance and grace imaginable. He accomplished a twelve mile hour gait around the short curves. Messrs. William and Edward Hanlon, Mr. T. R. Pickering and others also gave pleasing exhibition of their astonishing skill. It was a most successful as well as eminently satisfactory exhibition of the capacities of the velocipede as a medium of locomotion and healthful amusement after a short period of instruction and practice under the tuition of experienced masters.

To the velocipedal evolutions succeeded the graceful and, to the large number of ladies in attendance particularly, more pleasing features of the hop. It is unnecessary to describe the latter. Graffula's Seventh regiment band furnished the music. The dancing commenced at nine o'clock and continued several hours.

> Till the brain exhilarates  
> And ride, ride, ride,  
> As though followed by the Fates.  
> Street, and gutter, and lane—

> Till, past all others, you ride alone,  
> The speed is Oh! so fleet. 

> O men with money to spare,  
> O men with health and life,

> And lane, and gutter, and street—  
> And as you plough, you graceful bow  
> To those you choose to greet.  

> Ride, ride, ride, 
> In the cold and chilly air  
> And ride, ride, ride,  
> When the weather is warm and fair.  
> In dusty city and town  
> In country village and mead—  
> You'd better take some sound advice,  
> And get a Velocipede.  

> With cheeks so rosy and red,  
> With eyes so bright and blue,  
> A manly form, in manly dress,  
> Was riding our Broadway through.
