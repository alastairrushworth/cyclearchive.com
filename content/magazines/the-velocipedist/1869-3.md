# History of the Velocipede.

That there is nothing new under the Sun has been demonstrated in regard even to the velocipede, the very name of which, little more than a year ago, was unknown to nine out of every ten persons who spoke the English language. A recent writer in the _Galaxy_, not content with tracing the velocipede back to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, even goes so far as to intimate that the figures bestriding a "stick" on wheels, which we sometimes see in Egyptian relievos, show that, if the ancients had not a velocipede, they had something very like it.

We have, in previous numbers of The Velocipedist, sketched at some length, somewhat of the history of the velocipede; but, as additional facts bearing on this subject have recently come to our knowledge, we proceed to lay them before our readers. At a time when the velocipede has become an institution amongst us, it cannot but be interesting to compare previous crude inventions in this line with those modern ones which have resulted in the beautiful bicycle now in such general use.

To the _Scientific American_ we are indebted for the two following cuts and communication

![](/images/the-velocipedist/1869-3/_page_0_Picture_8.jpeg)

"In a small New England village, about the year 1823, a cute Yankee boy "might have been seen" (as G. P. R. James used to say), in fact, _was_ seen tearing round on a velocipede of his own construction, to the astonishment of the villagers and his own great delectation. The 'machine' was of rather a rude construction, as shown in the above cut, the wheels being of boards nailed together criscross, and the frame of such 'stuff' as a farmer's woodpile could furnish; but it would 'go like fun.' In principle, and even in form, it was identical with the present bicycle, the cranks being omitted, and on which some one, more witty than wise, claims a patent. There were the two wheels, tandem the forward one 'axled in the jaws of a depending bar, pivoted in the frame, and turned by a horizontal lever bar;' and it is presumed to have been constructed after a 'description' in some 'printed publication,' boys in those days not being thought adequate to the _invention_ of anything ! It was propelled by the _toes_ (not the flat foot) lightly touching the ground; and, though not as 'fast' as the crank-y concerns of the present hour, did very well for a little village and a country boy.

"That village was Norfolk, Litchfield county, Conn.; and the boy (an old boy now), your correspondent and admiring reader."
--Stockbridge, Mass., I. I. Pease.

The following, as will be seen, is a Water Veloce, and is intended to be propelled with the feet, by means of cranks, which turn a paddle wheel in the middle of the boat. 

![](/images/the-velocipedist/1869-3/_page_0_Picture_15.jpeg)

The steering is effected by cords attached to the tiller, and passing from the steering bar, under pulleys at the side of the boat, below and in front of the operator, and thence back to the tiller. The affair was, after all, a clumsy contrivance, and did not meet with public favor. Boston has whatever there is of honor in this invention.

Manufacturers of Velocipedes have found it necessary to devote much time of late to the investigation of the claims of numerous patentees. Witty and Hanlon having been attended to, makers were on the point of going to work again, when lo! a notice is served on them from an unexpected quarter, and they are requested to step up to a new captain's office and settle there. Mr. Stephen Wm. Smith, assignee of Mr. P. W. McKenzie, who in 1862 patented a cantering horse, claims that this covers the entire velocipede trade.

This cantering horse runs on three wheels, two in front and one behind. The upper part of the front legs are hinged at the body, while the feet are connected to the axle of the two front wheels, which axle is _"cranked,"_ so that the rider, sitting astride the horse, with feet on stationary rests, and holding on with his hands to a steering handle which passes through the neck or head of the horse, and is also connected with the steering or hind wheel, which is properly set between the hind legs of the horse. When thus seated the weight of the rider on the horse would naturally push down the cranks to their lower center. When, by standing on the foot rests, and thus relieving the horse of his weight, and at the same time pulling upwards by means of the handle the cranks are again brought up; and thus the wheels are rotated and the rider velocipeded forward. This forms the ground for a new claim to the favors of "Royalty." Manufacturers, however, can recognize but one legitimate Prince of "Cranks," and it is most assuredly their rights to require of these claimants that one or the other of them shall well and truly establish his right and title to the princely income, which the makers will then most willingly allow themselves to be taxed with.

Makers of Velocipedes will have to enter the ring themselves as patentees or inventors. With this idea, therefore, and also as an interesting fact in the history of Velocipedes, an illustration is here given of a Veloce, which we designed and had made in the year 1850, and consisting of two wheels and _driving cranks_. The model, which was made by a Mr. Gregory, who had at that time a shop on the southeast corner of 22d street and 8th avenue, corresponds with the accompanying engraving:--

![](/images/the-velocipedist/1869-3/_page_1_Picture_2.jpeg)

As shown here the two wheels were provided with driving cranks, the power being applied to a central shaft between the wheels by a coiled spring that had been taken from an alarm clock for the purpose. The central shaft was provided with a crank at each end, and these again were connected

two side rods, the ends of which were attached to the cranks of the driving wheels as on a locomotive. The cranks of each side being set at right angles to the cranks of the other side, it will he seen that the coiled spring would produce the required rotary motion of the wheels. The wheels of the model were made of tin, about 6 inches in diameter, and 8 inches broad, in the form of drums.

This model would run very quickly over a smooth floor until the spring had unwound itself. Afterwards, we had narrow strips or buckets placed on the periphery of each drum similar to the paddles of a steamboat, and the wheels or drums being water-tight made a fine Water Veloce. It used to very quickly unwind the thread from a spool, which was allowed to revolve on a piece of stout wire, held between the fingers.

---

— It is very probable that we shall soon know which of the two principal claimants has the right to demand and receive royalty for the use of cranks on a two-wheel velocipede. Some Spicy and Witty correspondence has lately passed between Messrs. Smith and Witty, and we now understand that Mr. Smith has made application to the Court for an injunction to restrain Mr. Witty from infringing his rights.

We may also here state that our own application for a Patent on our tubular frame, with the brass and gun metal sockets and bearings, peculiar self-oiling arrangement, and the polygonal or three or more sided stirrup, which is now so generally preferred, has been allowed by the Commissioner of Patents. It bears date March 30, and is numbered 88,507. This, we think, is about the last item of general interest in the velocipede line.

- The Boston Advertiser says:

"The velocipede is the greatest humbug of the season. For practical use on the roads in and about Boston the two-wheeled machine, as made at present, is ridiculous. There are two reasons for this:

"First, The motive power is applied in a way contrary to reason and mechanics. The power is used on the principle of a lever, the hub of the driving-wheel being the fulcrum, the treadle one end of the lever and the point of the tire touching the ground the other. But instead of applying the power at the long end of the lever, as reason and practice say it should be, it is applied at the short end, so that, unless the ground be as smooth and level as a floor, so much force is required that what is meant for pleasure becomes work or impossible."

We would recommend the writer of the above to apply immediately to some railroad company or locomotive shop for the position of locomotive constructor or superintendent, as all locomotives now in use apply the power (steam) _"at the short end of the lever."_ If this is contrary to reason and mechanics, then have we spent twenty years in the study and application of mechanics vainly. Let the Boston _Advertiser_ try again.

— The Pittsburg daily _Dispatch_ of March 26, speaking of the wonderful feats of Prof. Brady of the Hanlon's school, says that gentleman made _"an entire circuit of the room while standing on his head in the saddle."_ How about that _head feat_, Professor? Please let us know when you are going to repeat it.

— In a velocipede race at Indianapolis, a mile was made in three minutes and six seconds.

- __Blackstone on Velocipeding.__ As many of our velocipedestrians are somewhat solicitous about the interference of the police authorities in the matter of propelling their velocipedes on the side walks, we axe glad to be able to drop them a crumb of comfort, albeit reserving to ourselves the right to proclaim sidewalk velocipedes a nuisance should they become so. Already a judicial decision has been rendered in favor of velocipede riders, as will be seen by the following from the Toronto _Leader_, of Thursday

Yesterday an information was laid by the police before Mr. McNab, against Mr. John Dixon, for running a velocipede on the sidewalks, thereby obstructing the thoroughfare, and endangering the life and limbs of pedestrians. His worship was indisposed to grant the summons at present. He said the machine was a novel one, which the public was desirous of seeing, and so far, no evil consequences had resulted from its being run. He referred to the fact that in this city wheelbarrows, hand-carts, and baby-wagons, frequently obstruct the sidewalks, and are not banished therefrom. He also noticed that the newspaper carts were often driven at a much swifter speed than a trotting pace to the post-office, he presumed to save the mails, and no inconvenience appeared to have been felt on that score. He was disposed, therefore, to give the velocipedians a little more swing, and so long as they conduct themselves within the limits of discretion, he did not think himself called upon to interfere.

# Velocipeding in Pittsburgh.

The Smoky City Skating Rink was formally opened as a Velocipedrome on the evening of the 26th. The floor is about 140x85, well laid, but rather soft. White pine flooring we consider rather too soft for either durability or satisfactory riding—as in short turning the tires, especially of new machines, cut into the planks, and in consequent require considerable more power to propel the wheels. The usual opening exercises were gone through with, until about 9, when the Pickering Bro's, and two young ladies, all from the Hanlon Bro's New York School, went through some quartette movements, which gave very great satisfaction; it is now fully demonstrated that ladies may ride the bicycle with ease—and grace—and propriety. Machines are adapted for them, and a very slight alteration of an ordinary walking costume enabled them to either ride or walk without a change. The first appearance of ladies on Velocipedes seemed to take the Pittsburghers by surprise; they hardly knew how to receive them, but a few minute's riding decided that it was a success, the riding was frequently applauded, and Mr. W. S. Clow, the gentlemanly proprietor and tutor, was requested by many to open at once a class for ladies, which he will do so soon as machines can be

Mr. Clow, having heard of the _"Bridges"_ erected in some of the New York Schools determined to be a little ahead in that line, and consequently had one made for his Rink, which we think is the greatest obstruction yet surmounted by a Velocipede; it is five feet high at center, the inclined sides being but twelve feet long by four wide, giving a rise of _one foot in two_; this was a dangerous looking affair, having no railing at the sides, and being placed near the middle of the floor, required a steady hand, head, and feet; it was, however, successfully crossed several times; the younger Pickering letting go the handles just before reaching the top, yielded his machine over, and down and around the room entirely by his feet—two only of the scholars cared to attempt this feat, the first getting sufficient speed on his machine to carry it and him about half-way up the incline, from which point he very graciously _backed down_, the floor receiving him and his Veloce considerably _mixed_. A younger member, whose name has escaped us, and in whose make-up the word fail seems to have had no part, then tried his try, and passing the upper point came down the incline safely until he reached the floor, when he and his Veloce suddenly came to the ground; a second and third attempt proved more successful, and he now wants the bridge longer and higher. The usual game of tag finished the entertainment much to the amusement of the audience, who went home fully convinced of the success of the new sensation.

— "Velocipede" lays three languages under contribution for its composition. The German furnishes "viel," much; the English "hoss," well known in its meaning; and the French "pied," foot; from all of which it appears that velocipede is merely "much-hoss-afoot."

— The Empire City Velocipedrome was successfully dedicated to the new Art on the evening of Wednesday, the 31st. So far, we consider this the finest and best adapted room yet devoted to Velocing. The floor is well laid, and is of the proper material; it is also large enough to satisfy the ambition of the F. F. Vs., who have heretofore been limited as to space for their indoor exercises; it is also handsomely illuminated and well provided with all the necessaries calculated to render it comfortable. Shortly after eight o'clock the large concern became crowded with visitors, of whom the fair sex formed no inconsiderable portion, and when the lively strains of many popular airs burst forth, the scene became exceedingly animating and agreeable. The myriads of jets shed forth a brilliant light, and when the proceedings of the evening were formally commenced the occasion was replete with excitement and pleasurable anticipation. It was intended that the great concourse of spectators should have an opportunity of witnessing, in some degree, the perfection to which the art of riding the velocipede has been brought, and well and satisfactorily was the programme carried put. The machines of several manufacturers were brought into requisition, and judging by the favorable comments passed respecting their mode of construction generally, they seemed to realize the brightest expectations formed of them. But it was not so much the velocipedes as the riders that attracted attention. Never did gallant cavalcade of bold dragoons step forth in such martial array as the grand procession of over a hundred velocipedists. The following was the order of exercises: —Trial of Machines : —Mercer & Monod's, Pickering's, Wood's, Demorest's, Witty's, and Merrill's. It is needless to say that those mounted perfectly understood their business, and at intervals, not only delighted, but astounded the spectators by their difficult evolutions. The appearance and graceful riding of two young ladies, mounted on the new Veloce specially adapted for them, gave great satisfaction, and it is to be hoped that a good room will soon be secured for the special use of ladies in this city. Complete mastery was evidenced throughout, and not the slightest mishap occurred to mar the general harmony which prevailed. At times, the daring feats of the experts elicited great admiration, which vented itself in well-merited applause The proprietors of the establishment, Messrs. Kelly & Taxter, had reason to be satisfied with the result of their complete arrangements, for the inauguration was thoroughly successful.

— The Jersey City Skating Rink is now a Velocipede and Parlor Skating School, under the management of Frank Rivers. It will succeed. The opening took place on the evening of the 29th. P. T. Barnum delivered the address, which was _"Witty"_ enough, though occasionally _"cranky"_; he was continually putting in new _"spokes"_ to prevent the _"felloes"_ from getting _"tired."_ He said that while many did not know where to put their velocipedes, and while some put theirs in their parlors, some in the yard, some in the halls, and some stabled them, he would recommend his friends in the country who owned velocipedes, to _"Barn-um."_ He thought the ladies were sure to like the two-wheel Veloce, as the _"felloes"_ always hugged them very tight.

The usual _Velocipedestrianistical_ exercises followed the conclusion of this speech. Charleton rode his new Wood machine with his usual grace. The Pickering Bros, had two machines so very new that they (the machines) were not even painted. Mercer and Monod were on hand, and much good riding was the consequence. The Pickering and Monod game of Tag was called for, after which the Brooklyn Velocigymnasts went through their usual interesting performances. We also noticed Mr. Calvin Witty in the saddle. He is quite an expert on the _Lallament Treadle Cranks_.

— There will be some fast riding at Pearsall's new Appollo Gymnacyclidium, Broadway and Twenty-eighth street, on Thursday evening, the 15th inst, as on that occasion they offer a very valuable prize of a $250 Pickering Velocipede to the rider who shall make the best time; half mile run ten times around the hall. This, with the usual fine riding, will make up a pleasant entertainment for the evening.

— Three Englishmen have made the trip from London to Brighton (fifty miles) on velocipedes.

__Velocipedes in the Streets.__ — Man's own feet or crutches - and a wheeled vehicle with a horse in fronts—these, it seems, must be the Alpha and Omega of locomotion in the city streets. A wheeled vehicle without a horse is a thing so preposterous to the eyes of aldermen, that it must be forbidden altogether. Such is the experience of several cities, and our city promises to follow suit. Now, though the horse is favored by popular prejudice, a man may move his wagon with a mule, or a jackass, or a goat, or a dog; but he is not permitted to move it without one of those in front, or he will be fined twenty-five dollars. We recommend the sports to tie their tan terriers in front of the machine with a piece of pink ribbon, and go it on the same dodge adopted for the dummies, where an old blind horse trots in front of the locomotive within city limits. Although the aldermanic abdomen is a guarantee against any experiment of the Fathers on the velocipede, cannot some juvenile of aldermanic lineage convince the old fellows how ridiculous they are in endeavoring to prohibit what only needs regulation? - _Herald._

— _Cammeyer's Union Grounds, Velocipede Track_ has at last been opened to meet the requirements of the votaries of the new and elegant semiequestrian pastime for those ladies, gentlemen and children who have been drawn into the vortex or prevailing mania for velocipeding. The Herald has been called on to coin a new word for this location, the result of which is Amphicyclotheatron—(unabridged). The attendance of both ladies and gentlemen was quite numerous, both in the afternoon and evening, notwithstanding the cold, blustering wind, and over thirty experts, more or less known as among the prominent velocipedists of the country (including two ladies), kept the wheels of the various machines of different makers in motion in the liveliest manner. A band of music both afternoon and evening added to the pleasure and excitement of the scene, and at night there was a display of fireworks. The following gentlemen and lads figured in the various trials of speed and exhibitions of skill: Messrs. John and Robert Witty, Thomas Hovell, a five-year old Witty, whom all the ladies said was a perfect love of a little fellow, and the gentlemen swore was a regular brick. The Tilden Brothers and Tilton Brothers, from ten to sixteen years old, gave a fine display in several acts, in which they rode the machine in twos, threes and fours, at a time (_a la_ circus), which we think would look very well in a circus. Mr. Abner Brady and the Pickering Brothers were also on hand, and some speed was obtained.

— Pearsall's new School, Appollo Hall, Broadway and Twenty-eighth Street, was the scene of the most interesting _"opening"_ or _"commencement"_ yet witnessed in this country on Monday evening, the 5th. A most fashionable audience was gathered to witness the best display yet made of Velocipedes. The contrast between this gathering and the attendance at the Twenty-second street hall the night the Peaesalls inaugurated the first Velocipede school, was striking. A very attractive programme was prepared, and carried out fully and satisfactorily. A feature of the exhibition was the introduction of lady amateurs. A sister of the _Pearsalls_, riding the _Lawson_ Ladies' Machine, and the _Pickering_ sisters, riding the _Pickering_ Ladies' Machine. The ladies rode with a degree of modest grace charmingly attractive, and their skill was envied by the fair sex present. An unusual number of fine machines were exhibited' — two of Pickerings, at $200 each, one of Wood's, at $500, a fine Demorest and a new Dexter, not forgetting the Laubach _Keystone_ machine, in which the Pearsalls seem specially interested.

— Race for a Silver Cup on Cammeyer's track, Brooklyn, E. D.; halfmile heats; three times around the track, on 33 inch machines; seven entries; first run by Alden and Godwin, Jr. : time, Godwin, 2.13; second run by Comstock and Tuttle: time, Comstock, 2.10; third run by Lethbridge, Copeland, and Morrell : time, Morrell, 2.05, Morrell taking the Cup.

Cammeyer seemed to be in his elements as he stood on the track with jackknife and stick in hand, starting the boys, and whittling at the same time. He proposes to have next a race on 37 inch machines, to be followed by one on 40 inch machines.

— The velocipede people down East are getting aristocratic. They now call a velocipede school an "Academy."

# American Velocipedes in England.

The following is an extract from a letter recently received in this city from England

> "Your Velocipede that we have just received by steamer City of New York, is certainly, in our opinion, and in that of all who have viewed it, very superior in every respect to anything hitherto seen or manufactured on this side of the Atlantic.

> "We sent it up to the Gymnasium, where it was ridden at the daily exhibition of the Club, and contrasted very favorably with all other makes—the motion being easier, the appearance more graceful, and the finish very superior to any—but, having no brake attached, was a great disadvantage; so that, in future shipments, you will please not omit to supply us with that addition."


# The Monocycle.

We have had so many inquiries in regard to the Monocycle, or onewheel Velocipede, that we have determined to get up one, which shall be clear of many of the objections which are urged against those we have so far seen. We shall have it completed in time to give an engraving of it in our next number. We think that we can dispense entirely with the use of not only the steering arms, but even the cranks, although it is worked by the feet; and we consider that the same machine will be adapted for either boys or men, short or tall persons—and even ladies. It may be easily mastered (we think), and in case the rider falls, the machine will not fall on him; in fact, it will not be capable of falling on its side; and further, it will not infringe any known patent. Still further, it is _not_ a _wheelbarrow_.

# Velocipedisms.

— The _Herald_ is responsible for the following: At Jacksonville, 111., recently, a Mr. Dunlap, while exercising at Professor Graver's hall, accidentally rode down an inclined plane to a level with the window sill, passed through the open window, and leaped an alley ten feet wide. He alighted with his Veloce on the roof of a drug store, a story lower, and the machine rode down the roof and over the eaves, landing on the roof of Ayres' Bank. At this stage of the proceeding, Mr. Dunlap fell off the Veloce, and was saved from a terrible death thereby. A large crowd witnessed the perilous ride from the windows.

— Josh Billings says, on the subject, thusly:

> "It don't take much stuff to build a filosipede. I am bold tew say that a man could make one ov 'em out of a cingle old plank, and then hev enough stuff left over to splinter broken limbs, or make, perhaps, a corfin.

> "A filosipede can't stand alone, and that single fact iz enuff to condemn the think in mi eye. I don't want to have anything to do with any helpless critter that can't stand alone, onless, I might addd, it is a purty woman going for to faint.

> "I don't think it will ever get in tew gineral use among farmers, azit haz no conveniences for a hay riggin, nor even a place to strap a trunk; and as tew going to church on it, the family would have tew go one at a time, and the rest walk. So of course the thing is killod in that direction."

— "Kriugle," in the Schenectady _Star_, thus gives his views of the Velose "The filosipede at first sight looks very much as tho it wuzzent all thare, and I told Kusick wen I fusa saw it that ef he'd go and get the box and the rest of the wheels I'd perceed tew business; but the durned thing, standin' thar agin a post, looked like a livery rig that had been druv straddle of a rail fence five miles tew town by some adventurous sport.

— Mr. Cuyler, the Engineer in charge of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, announces, officially, that the velocipede riders have been and are permitted to make use of the walks of the Park, and are also allowed to use the tarred area or plaza and walks at Fort Green. The question of the general use of the Park by velocipede riders has not, as yet, been officially acted upon.

From the above it wil be seen that velocipedists can avail themselves of all the privileges in Prospect Park granted to equestrians, for they can use all the bridle paths and plazas in the Park.

— The Brooklyn _Union_ of March 4th says that "Palm Johnson, the noted Brooklyn skater, returned from Paris last week, and he informs us that not only have we better velocipedes here than they have in Paris, and greater facilities for practice under cover, but that the most expert riders now in Paris are Americans. He says that the Parisians would be astonished to see the beautiful machines our makers turn out."

— Professor Brady, late of the Seventh Eegiment Gymnasium, is the champion acrobatic. He can urge the bicycle at full speed along any sort of course, from Nicholson pavement to a tightrope. Brady challenges to race all comers with his head in a sack, his feet in flour barrels, and his hands tied behind his back.

— The down town exercise halls are in full run - "from early morn till dewy eve." Chase's establishment, Vesey street, Perego's, Nassau street, and Pangborn's, Fulton street, are admirably managed.

— How to ride a velocipede — straddle a saddle, then paddle and skedaddle.

— A number of prominent velocipedists of this city held a meeting at Apollo Hall, for the purpose of organizing a club, to be called the American Velocipede Club, on the evening of the 23d ult. Mr. Harry Alden presided, and Messrs. F. Carpenter, O. Lefferts, and B. Matthews, were appointed a committee to draw up constitution.

— An elderly gentleman has invented a one-wheeled velocipede, which is quite a novelty. It does away with seat, pedals, breaks, and all. There is a crank attached to the axle on each side of the wheel. You sit between the spokes, and turn the crank with your hands. The rider goes round with the wheel, turning a somerset at each revolution. The sensation is therefore peculiar, and the ride is much more exciting than on the ordinary velocipede. The objections to this style is, they can never be used by ladies.

A newspaper man, and a real good one too, is the champion fallist in the velocipede school. He is evidently a goist of another school. Mustang liniment for one.

In Pittsburg, the velocipede is called the lightning-catcher. In St. Paul they style it the "Go Devil." In New York, "The New Sensation." In Boston, "The Firey, Untamed Steed." In Baltimore, "The Wooden Dexter." In Chicago, "The Wooden Devil."

Velocipedestrianisticalistinarianologist is the latest addition to the language.

One of the most prominent localities for velocipede exercise this spring will be Tompkin's Square, which presents a fine level and clear space near a mile in circumference. It is shortly to be graveled and rolled, as soon as the frost is out of the ground. Many of the members of the City Government have become velocipedists, and they intend that our city-riders shall have a space to roam about in on their bicycle steeds.

Rev. Arthur Edwards, Assistant Editor of the _Northwestern Christian Advocate_, said to be a most expert velocipedestrian, has had rubber tires put upon the wheels of his "Pickering," and finds it practicable by their use to ride over ice and snow without slipping. He believes that their use would be advantageous in summer as well as in winter, as the rubber would relieve the jar from roughness of roads.

A large number of Yonkers ladies are looking for the "coming man."

A Providence merchant went out velocipede riding a few days ago. Desirous to show his skill in turning a corner, he put on too much speed, turned the guide post the wrong way, went into a shop window, cut his nose, frightened the customers, was arrested, taken away from his bicycle, paid $125 damages, recovered his steed, and rode home a sadder if not a wiser man.

Much sport has been created in Holyoke, Mass., by the exhibition of an old-fashioned spinning wheel as a velocipede. So few of the present generation were familiar with the ancient machine that the hoax was very successful.

A correspondent desires to know about which there is the most lying—velocipede races or appointments to office.

Mr. Foot, of Hanlons' school, is a fast and fancy rider, and masters one of Pickerings' largest machines.

__A Velocipede in State Street.__ — This morning persons who passed through State street were treated to a novel exhibition to many, that of a young gentleman (Mr. Alonzo S. Briggs, of New York) performing numerous evolutions on the velocipede, running on the pavements. The machine was manufactured by Messrs. Pickering & Davis, of No. 144 Green street, New York, who claim that it possesses many advantages over others. It is made of hollow pipe and gun metal, with a spiral spring and saddle, and passes over the pavements with perfect ease. The same gentleman has made trips to Newton and Brighton, giving some of the horses on the road a close race, and proposes to make a trip to Gloucester with his iron horse. The machine has been running six months, and is as perfect now as when first put in operation. - _Boston Telegraph._

Velocipede butter is common in Minnesota—worked by Norwegians with their feet.

__Tolls for Velocipedes.__ — At the Southampton Petty Sessions, on Tuesday, Edward Andrews, Collector of Tolls, was summoned for taking toll of Mr. Page. Mr. Guy appeared for complainant, and stated that all Mr. Jones wished for was not to be charged every time he passed over the bridge. Mr. Jones, in this instance, was charged twopence for the Velocipede, as a wheelbarrow, which it could not be, and therefore he did not know what the defence would be. Mr. Starks, from the office of Mr. Page, Clerk to the Northam Bridge Company, applied for an adjournment in order for Mr. Page to be present, but defendant said he was quite willing to abide by the decision of the bench that day. The defence set up by Andrews was that he charged for trucks and perambulators, and that he had a perfect right to charge for the Velocipede under the same clause. The bench, after some consideration, said the case would be adjourned until Wednesday next. It would be considered closed, and the adjournment was only in order that the magistrates might consult Mr. Eldridge, and give their decision. - _English Paper._

The Hanlons have thirty-three machines constantly running at their "Velocipedrome," corner of Broadway and Tenth street.

Sarah Jane Bates writes to the Binghamton _Republican_ that her husband goes out days and rides a Velocipede, and then keeps up the propelling motion with his feet all night. She don't like it.

Nearly every County Agricultural Society in Ohio offers a premium on Velocipede riding.

A young lady in this city wants to "trade a sewing-machine for a Velocipede." She thinks she could "get along" if she had a spinning wheel.

The latest style of collar is called the "Velocipede." The points are so long that they jab holes through the pantaloons at the knees. When washed and hung on the clothes line, one of them looks like a pair of drawers. One reason they are named after the Velocipede is because they are "turn-overs."

— Two editors in Chicago undertook to produce a velocipede on a new and improved pattern. One was to furnish the money, and the other the inventive skill. A large three-wheeled affair was secretly constructed in a basement, and when finished it was found to be several inches wider than the doorway. The two editors are consulting whether to tear down the house or the velocipede.

— A Troy military company talk of making a parade on velocipedes the coming season.

__Of what Genus and Species?__ — There is an old story of a toll-gate keeper who had to assess, by his. schedule, the rates for a gypsey caravan of street showmen; and who saw clearly that "asses is 'osses and goats is sheep, and monkeys and women are men; but that 'ere," said he, pointing to a bear in a garbage cart, drawn by two dogs in harness; "what is that?" The same question has arisen concerning a velocipede at a toll-bridge in England. The collector, after mature deliberation, decided that the word "wheelbarrow" was the only one in his list which could be so construed as to embrace the animal ridden, and charged it two pence accordingly. The rider appealed to a magistrate, who, for aught we know, is still considering the question. The natural history of the velocipede must, therefore, be considered as unsettled until the decision comes. But since an unruly one kicked a clergyman to death in Paris, just after Lamartine's funeral, it may be thought desirable to lay, at least, quite as heavy a tax upon all such violent and dangerous animals as upon horses.

One of the most interesting features of that thoroughly wide-awake and excellent journal, the _Evening Telegram_, is its choice velocipede items.

The _Velocipede Manual_ is a very neatly got up publication, for the instruction of beginners, and contains much that is interesting even to experts. Its cost is 15 cents. The American News Company are the agents.

A series of contests for speed took place at the Pittsburgh City Hall on the evening of the 25th—distance, half mile, nine entries. 1st prize, solid gold Veloce, for watch-chain; won by Mr. Logan; time, 2:08. 2d prize, a Gold Pen and Case; won by Mr. Herron; time, 2:09. 3d prize, a Season Ticket; won by J. C. Conroy; time, 2:11 Slow riding followed by fancy and trick riding, concluded the entertainment, and Messrs. Sherwin, Whipple & Co., managers, deserve credit.

— Anna Dickinson was recently obliged to charter a locomotive to take her from Des Monies to Mount Pleasant, where she had made an engagement to lecture in the evening. Cause—being ten minutes too late to take the train. Anna should buy a velocipede.

__A Velocipedist Arrested__ - Mr. Austin T. Ashmead has the honor to be the first one prosecuted under the order published by the chief-of-police, prohibiting velocipedists from riding on the sidewalks. The complaint was made by the city attorney, Wm. Hammersly, and brought before the Court this morning. But in the absence of Mr. Hammersly, the case was postponed until Thursday. Hon. W. W. Eaton appears for Mr. Ashmead. As there is no law against velocipedes, there is considerable interest manifested in the result of the case, a number of prominent velocipede- riders being in the court-room. - _Hartford Com._


# The Velocipede Clock.

Considerable difficulty occurs in Riding Schools, where machines are let by the hour, and where the number of riders is large, to allow each one his full allowance of time without overrunning it. The usual method is to put the rider's name on a slate, with the time at which he takes the velocipede; by referring to the clock he is called in by name when his time is up. This plan has been much simplified. The velocipedes in a school are all numbered; a clock face is then prepared by having the glass removed, and a number of holes made in the face just outside the circle of figures, or minute dots. When a rider takes a Veloce, its number is noticed, and a small wooden pin, numbered to correspond with the machine taken, is placed in the hole nearest at the time to the point of the minute-hand. It is evident that in just one hour the hand will have made a circuit of the face, and will then point at the numbered pin—when that number will be called and the machine returned, or retaken. One clock prepared in this manner, by having a hole at each of the minute dots, will answer for a school of sixty machines. It is also evident that if a machine is wanted for thirty or fifteen minutes, the numbered pin should be placed thirty or fifteen minutes ahead of the minute hand at the time the velocipede is engaged. __Joe G. Pangburn__, of this city, we believe, is the inventor of this _time-ly_ arrangement.

# Mrs. Caudle on the Velocipede.

_From the Utica Herald._

Caudle, I would like to know what makes your face so red ! You look as if you had been intoxicated for a week. I do declare this is too bad. Was there ever a woman in this world so" -

Mr. C. exclaims — "Now, my dear, don't take on so. You know a new vehicle of locomotion has been introduced in town. It is called the velocipede. I rode one of these at the hall to-night before coming home, and it is hot work, especially for beginners. Been drinking! No, I haven't drank anything for six months!

Mrs. C. — "There, Caudle, just, just look at that! Torn the best pair of pants you had in the house ! Now, how did that come about?"

Mr. C. — "Well, you see, I rode the velocipede this forenoon, and another machine ran into mine, and before I knew it my pants were torn."

Mrs. C. — "Ripped your coat, too, haven't you? You didn't want me to see that tear ! And here's your best beaver smashed up! Perhaps you'll say the velocipede did that? It did, did it? But, Mr. Caudle, what's the matter with your hands? Why they are all blistered up."

Mr. C. — "Three days riding the velocipede is enough to blister anybody's hands; but it's nothing when you get used to it. Happens to all beginners."

Mrs. C. — "What is the matter now, Caudle? You limp as if you had been horribly injured!"

Mr. C. — "A slight bruise, only a slight bruise; keep me in the house only a day or two. You see, Jack, and he weighs three hundred and fifty pounds, accidentally drove his velocipede over my foot, and yet one must endure these little things in order to become an adept in riding the velocipede."

Mrs. C. — "Now I would like to know where you've been all this blessed evening, Caudle! Here it is fifteen minutes of midnight and you just coming home to your lawfully wedded wife. No! You needn't say that you have been to the lodge, because I know it isn't lodge night."

Mr. C. — "No, my dear, I haven't been to the lodge. You see, in order to become an adept"

Mrs. C. — "Now, Caudle, I know what you were going to say. You were going to tell me that you must desert me every night for six weeks while you learn to ride a velocipede. If wives had their way they'd bum every velocipede in town ! And what was the matter with you last night? I couldn't get a wink of sleep. Your legs kept going up and down all night like pump handles. Velocipede motion, was it. Put your feet in the stirrups and turn and that throws your knees up and down, does it? Now don't tell me it's nothing when I get used to it, because that's something I won't get used to! It is bad enough to sleep with a man when he is quiet, but to have the bed clothes flopping up and down all night as regularly as that clock ticks, is a little too much, velocipede or no velocipede. If you ride the velocipede another day, Caudle, I'll leave the house!" And with this conclusion the lady ceased, finding her worthy spouse was already fast asleep.

# Mrs. Wilkins on Velocipedes.

_From the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin._

But, Wilkins I - 
"I tell you, Mrs. Wilkins, I'm not going to have it; you may as well make up your mind to that at once. No woman shall ever go prancing around this community on a velocipede while she's a wife of mine if I can help it; so you can just take that old pair of wheels you brought home and gladden the heart of some kindling wood man with them, for ride on them you don't; if you do I'm a Dutchman; there!"

"Mr. Wilkins, you know I - "

"No, I don't know anything of the kind. Do you think I'm going to let such a looking woman as you dress up in Bloomers and mount a high hat and go around trying to show off _that_ figure?"

"Mr. Wilkins!"

"Go staggering around the thoroughfares of this town, looking like an old beer cask propped upon two legs, and showing those ankles, which are so thick that you couldn't get one of them through the equator?"

"Wilkins, I'll scratch - "

"Well, I should think not. And, besides, I don't know whereabout on this terrestrial globe you expect to find any wheels strong enough to bear you. You'd smash a pair of cast-iron car-wheels into smithereens the minute you sat down on them, you would. The best thing you can do is to walk, and on the ground, too, where the crust of the earth isn't thin; or else sit in front of a fire, and melt down your avoirdupois."

"Mr. Wilkins, your perfectly scandalous."

"But I'm not going to put up with it. I don't intend to have you flopping around town on a velocipede, and very likely falling off and breaking your bones, and then have a lot of doctors coming to my house and making _post_ mortem examinations, and sawing you up, and discovering things with hard Latin names in your lungs, and in your liver, and your physique generally. Well, I should think not ! It's bad enough to have to submit to you now, without having your gore spilt around over the carpet, and a parcel of sawbones blaspheming at your anatomy. I - "

"Wilkins, ain't you ashamed to talk so ?"

"I want you to understand that if you ride that velocipede I will sue for a divorce. I don't believe in a woman exercising her muscles on any such contrivance. You'd a good deal better get a scrubbing-brush and go down and tackle the front door steps with some sand and a chunk of soap. That's the kind of exercise you want, in my opinion."

"Mr. Wilkins, if you'll only listen - "

"Or else practice carrying a coal-scuttle up and down stairs every five minutes all day. But as for the mother of a family, and a flabby old girl of your years, undertaking to ride a velocipede, why, it's simply ridiculous.

"Mr. Wilkins, I - "

"The next thing I know, I suppose you will be parading yourself in the papers as 'Madame Wilkins, the Champion Velocipedist,' and running mile heats on the Nicolson pavement for hundred-dollar purses, best two out of three. A beautiful spectacle won't it be? And then I suppose you will want me to bet on you, and back you up; but not one cent of my cash do you get. Not a single, solitary red. Do you suppose that I am going to throw away my hard-earned money on such a fanatic as you? Well, I should think not. I would not put up a dollar on you if I was worth untold billions. I'm not proud of you; I want you to distinctly understand that."

"Mr. Wilkins, that's all nonsense."

"And a pretty example you are setting to your children. Here only yesterday, Holfernes Montgomery made a velocipede out of two flour barrels, and when he and Bucephalus Alexander tried to mount it, it broke down and hit Mary Jane on the leg, and lamed her for life, while Holfernes Montgomery fell over the cat, which yowled and spitted around, and scratched Holfernes Montgomery over the frontispiece, so that his beauty is destroyed, and he looks more like you than ever. I say that it is perfectly outrageous, and I'm not going to stand it.

"Mr. Wilkins! Oh, if you will listen, I'll tell you something."

"Oh! I don't want to hear it. We'll discontinue the conversation. I'm tired of hearing you cackle."

"Well, that velocipede came home - "

"Never mind now. I want to go to sleep. Just give your tongue a chance to rest, will you?"

"Was for you. I heard you say you wanted one, so I bought it out of the market money I saved. Bat you treat me like such a brute, that I—I—I—"

"For me, did you say, Sarah ? Well, then, never mind now. Don't cry, Sarah, I say. Never mind; I won't do it again. Sarah! Sarah! Don't cry. Sa — rah ! Oh, well then, cry; who cares ? You're the most aggravating woman that ever lived. I'll get on that velocipede to-morrow morning, and abandon you as sure as my name is Wilkins. If I don't, hang me!"

# Brick Pomeroy on a Velocipede.

As a horsebackist, we have been called a success. Once we rode a mile. On another occasion we rode a brindle cow home from the fair, not to add to our comfort, but to pay the aforesaid bovine for not drawing the premium."On another occasion we undertook to ride a speckled steer, but for some reason or other, his finis department had a sudden inclination to elevate itself into the air, and we dismounted over his head, simply because the mane of the beast did not amount to much for hanging on purposes. On another occasion we rode a saw-mill saw for half an hour, but we never tried it again.

But we did try the velocipede. We got astride of it, and started. Immediately after a gentleman was discovered lying on the ground, to the merriment of lookers on. Once more we mounted the breach, if by these words a cast-iron pad may be called, and undertook to propel the invention. Just then a gentleman struck his head with extreme violence against the curbstone. More merriment. Another attempt, and just then a gentleman was discovered sprawling upon the ground with his left ear full of mud. More merriment, but not on the part of the victim. Pretty soon we got well under way, by the aid of two men to push and a small boy to steer, while we were getting nsed to the contrivance. But at such an hour as we knew not of our assistants departed from us. We made two lunges ahead, and while endeavoring to turn out for a young lady, cramped the wrong way, collided, took her on the invention in front of us, and we both went off together, to the damage of a $10 hat and a $23 Grecian bend. The glory of that hat and that bend departed with much quickness, never more to return. As for the lady, we pray the Lord to pardon her for the feelings she entertains towards us, for really we could not help it.

Well, we tried it again. Undertook to cross the street, and accidentally ran our contrivance plump against the hind end of a charcoal wagon. We got off, while the industrious velocipede took a scoot to the left, landing in the gutter. Such a nice place to put your feet! Good deal like sitting on a grindstone turning it with your toes. Aside from the delightful sensation experienced, it strains the muscles and is more wearing upon garments. Riding a two-story Indian hog just turned loose to fat on beech nuts would be sweet cream in comparison with this invention. Sliding down hill on a hand-saw, tooth side up, would be two degrees more comfortable than experimenting on one of these contrivances—but then it is fashionable! If any of our readers have a suit of clothes they wish to spoil, seven or eight pairs of legs they would lame for seven weeks, a high finished and moral back they don't care for, fifteen or sixteen yards of court plaster; a dozen or more new hats, several pairs of boots, and the Lord only knows how many coat tails to spoil, let him buy a velocipede and commence practice at once. To purchase one of the confounded things requires but a small fortune; say twice as much as is necessary to purchase a handcart, which is by far the most comfortable to ride on; while a few dollars extra would last about four hours for insurance against accidents. Go and try it. Buy one. Rush around with it. But first, employ a physician by the month to doctor you for all bruises, contusions, sprains, rheumatism, compound, vulgar, and improper fractions, and every ailment under the sun, when you may be happy yet. We have tried it — it is nice. The next day the velocipede went off as smoothly as usual, but as to its rider, that's altogether another matter. We have not been able to walk up and down stairs without the aid of a cane for a week. Have hardly spoken a good natured word for a fortnight. Our best pants are at the tailor's, and not less than ninety-three bottles of liniment stand grinning at us from every room we occupy during the day. If there is some fellow you have a spite against, coax him to try a velocipede; when, in all probability; he will bring an action against you for wilful intent to murder, or, at least, assault and battery, and make his action stick. Yours on two wheels.

_Brick Pomeroy._
