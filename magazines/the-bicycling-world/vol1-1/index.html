PRATT</strong> • Editor and Manager<br> <strong>THE BICYCLING WORLD CO.</strong> • Publishers and Proprietors<h1 id=currente-calamo>Currente Calamo</h1><p>The jaunty bicycler of the cut on our inside page waves his last good-by to-day. His cap was lost by the wayside long ago; his bicycle is already antiquated, and the scenes have changed. He is still ahead of his winged pursuer, after two years of the fervid race, and is good for another spurt. But the heavy scroll impedes; it is caught from him by a brisker breeze, and gracefully, as a winner should, he dismounts.<p>"The world was not made in a day," nor is <strong>The Bicycling World</strong> perfected in one number.<p>It's Cann and Will both with one of our visiting riders.<p>Our interpreting bicycler, Patrie, speaks of the visiting French champion in a way that sounds as "Mr. Tear on." And nimbly he does Terront.<p>When the funny man of <strong>Harper's Bazar</strong> artist corps is proposed for admission to a club, we hope he will not be black-balled on account of his recent giving himself away. It's worth something to have such an erratic wobbler to amuse us.<p>"Alas, poor Yor(ic)k!" That bicycle club is reported to be "a myth," after all. But perhaps the announcement was a prophecy. With a nucleus of four riders it will soon have its club. Already Pennsylvania, with its four, stands next to Massachusetts in its number of these aids to enjoyment.<p>With its usual enterprise <strong>Lippincott's</strong> leads the magazines with the first article on the bicycle, though it was not the first to move in the matter. It is a stiff up-grade to those lofty editorial sancta, but they will all be reached in time.<p>Whatever their political opinions or expectations may have been, forty wheelmen, at least, will have kindly feelings of loyalty to the new Governor of Massachusetts, and long remember the courtesy which prompted him, in the midst of a busy campaign, to remain at his home in Hingham until one o'clock, that he might extend his hospitable cheer and coffee to the far-spinning excursioners.<p>By the way, if the Governor and Council were "able and discreet" enough to adopt the free and independent bicycle on their usual rounds, what an amount of expenses would be saved to the State, and how easily the question of free passes could be settled!<p>It looked very much, last week, as if Harry Etherington had introduced a new commodity of Canned beat to us Americans. But Terront spoiled that joke.<p>President Chandler, of the Suffolk Bi. C., knows a good run when he finds it. He took one down the Blackstone valley this season, and was greeted by a hearty Uxbridge citizen: "Well, you and Van Amburgh's circus are the only people that's been down this way for twenty year."<p>People who bow to us at the news-stand should remember that our paper is like a nut, in having the meat inside, - and crack it.<p>"Every one knows that we have in this country no bicyclists able to make any sort of a show against the Englishmen." - <em>Spirit of the Times</em>, 8 Nov., 1879.<p>Now how does "every one" know that, Mr. Spirit? Cann has already been beaten fairly on his fastest mile by two Americans. And bicyclers know that our fastest racing men at present are among the amateurs. Let Mr. Etherington try a match with some of these, or bring on some amateurs who can. Our sporting contemporary might be just as bright and yet be a little less supercilious towards bicycling.<p>One thing happens to all alike, - bicyclers or nonbicyclers, - sooner or later we must all take a header, as the parson said when he passed the cemetery.<p>He came up to us in the tent one evening, last week, a drooping, dreamy-eyed young man, and said, "I have a charming little roundelay on -<blockquote><p>"Beautiful, bonnie bright blanket of snow, Downily draping the "</blockquote><p>Here he made a cæsural pause, and tried in vain to lift his hat from his nose and ears. He was borne outside by shivering men in knee-breeches. They rolled him in the "beautiful blanket." They tucked the corners of it into his mouth and neck. They set him on a frosty bicycle, and gave him a start. It was a charming little round he lay on the beautiful, etc., and he felt no doubt, as we did, that it is a cold, cold world—for November.<h1 id=the-clubs-reviewed>The Clubs Reviewed</h1><h2 id=the-suffolk-bicycle-club>The Suffolk Bicycle Club.</h2><p>This club is the largest in point of membership, and first in the number of its long and short distance amateur riders, of known strength and skill, in America. It was first organized in the spring of 1878, by a number of young gentlemen of Boston, who framed for its government a constitution of eleven articles, twelve bylaws, fourteen road rules, and eight racing rules, all of which, however, were not formally adopted, though for the most part acted under during the riding season of 1878. The strong interest taken by its members soon developed some accomplished riders; their success encouraged others; races, both public and private, were engaged in; the Club grew in numbers, and, at the close of the season in 1878, a new set of rules and a change in organization were found necessary to meet the requirements of a body of this kind.<p>The first meeting for the reorganization of the Club was held February 27, 1879, when new rules (printed below), modeled after the best attainable English rules, were presented and adopted. In these rules the English practice was followed, of directing the business of the Club in as simple a way as practicable, because complexity, undesirable in any organization, was specially to be avoided in a club formed for a healthful and pleasurable exercise. From this time the number of members rapidly increased, and the roll, including three honorary members, now numbers eighty.<p>The growth of the Club necessitated a club-room, which was hard to find, as the requirements of a bicycle club are peculiar. A room, answering the purpose reasonably well, was at last obtained at 36 Charles street, Boston. This club-room is believed to be the most complete of its kind, either in England or America. In England very few bicycle clubs have club-rooms.<p>The Suffolk Club-room is intended not only to furnish a convenient place for club meetings, but a reading-room, where all the periodicals of value relating to bicycling, with the more important sporting papers, English and American, are to be had, as well as a dressing-room, where lockers, with washing accommodations, are at hand as a convenience to riders. The room is also provided with some of the best maps and itineraries of the State, so that members may acquaint themselves with the roads, and arrange tours over any part of the Commonwealth. A bulletin-board is used to convey the latest intelligence, and a complaint or suggestion book is kept for hints or requests as to the conduct of the rooms or wants of members. There is a janitor in charge, whose services the members can command, and the rooms are always accessible to members by key.<p>Without giving the record of its racing members in detail—a record which has improved with each succeeding season, and which has for the most part appeared in the press of the day—we print below the rules of this Club, together with a list of its present officers and members.<h2 id=rules>Rules.</h2><ol><li><p>This Club shall be named the "Suffolk Bicycle Club."</p><li><p>The Officers of the Club shall be a President, Captain, Sub-Captain, five Directors, and a Secretary who shall also be Treasurer.</p><li><p>The Officers shall be elected by ballot at the Annual Meeting in March, by a majority of votes, and shall serve until successors are chosen.</p><li><p>The business of the Club shall be attended to by the Club Committee, which shall consist of the five Directors, and the President, Captain, Sub-Captain, and Secretary, ex-officio.</p><li><p>Five members of the Club Committee shall form a quorum at Committee meetings.</p><li><p>Reports of the Club Committee must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the members of the Club present and voting, excepting reports on the Election of Members, under Rule Nine.</p><li><p>Membership to the Club shall be strictly confined to gentlemen amateurs.</p><li><p>An amateur is one who has never competed for public money, or with a professional for a prize, public money, or admission money, and who has never taught or assisted in the pursuit of athletic exercises as a means of livelihood.</p><li><p>Any gentleman wishing to join the Club must be proposed, and address, with the names and addresses of those who propose and second him, shall then be referred to the Club Committee, who shall report thereon at the next Club meeting, at which two black balls shall exclude.

Leaving home at 7 a.m., I proceeded quickly to the polls, where I met a fellow-cycler, and having done our duty to our country, we kept on our way, crossing the Schuylkill by Gray's Ferry bridge, and then through the City of Brotherly Love to South-st. Wharf, where on the Gloucester ferry-boat we found a number of shining steeds whose owners greeted us most warmly. The twenty minutes spent in steaming down the Delaware passed most pleasantly as we oiled and tightened our machines, and then sat in the upper cabin and indulged in ludicrous remarks at the expense of passing craft. At 8.20 a.m. we left Gloucester, nine in number, all in high spirits, riding in single file along the southern turnpike, a little sandy at first, but soon hard and firm as any floor.<p>As we rounded the corner at the first toll-gate I looked back and saw a pretty sight as the steel spokes glistened in the morning sunlight and the blue and gray shirts (representing respectively the Philadelphia and Germantown clubs) marched straight on with a narrower gauge than even the new railroad to Atlantic City. The Jersey turnpikes are generally made of fine gravel, rounded well up in the middle, and sloping more or less abruptly down on either side, with one good wagon track that is quite hard, and with soft slopes outside of it; but the drivers were mostly considerate enough to turn out for us a foot or two, and allow us to go by them without changing our course.<p>In thirty minutes we reached Woodbury (5 m.) where we joined the citizens in running to a small fire; but the old-fashioned hand fireengine which they brought out was not even put into use, so we soon took up the line of march, and at 9 a.m. were on our way down the incline to Mantua creek. A drove of steers going in the same direction was a decided hindrance for some time, and one large animal turned directly across my path, so that I ran plump into his side; he was less incommoded than I was, but I soon remounted, and with the others toiled up Cooper's hill, not steep but long, and with the strong westerly wind it made us blow. At Mantua (3 m.) the people stared, with mouths wide open, but on we sped; our ranks now scattered through Lawrenceville, then down a smart incline with legs over handles to Raccoon creek and up to Mullica hill (5 m.), where at 9.50 we halted to give ourselves some water and our machines some oil. Ten minutes sufficed to bring six of us together, and we turned slightly to the right, along a ridge with beautiful views of Pennsylvania far away across the river. Dinner had been ordered at Woodstown (8 m.), and my animal seemed to be imbued with my own feelings, for away he flew up hill and down along the splendid road, and at 10.50 I leaped from the saddle in front of the hotel and was warmly welcomed by mine host. Some of my<h1 id=club-doings>Club Doings</h1><h2 id=boston-bi-c>Boston Bi. C.</h2><p>At a regular meeting held on Monday evening, November 3, 1879, two matters of especial interest were agitated.<p>The "head-quarters" of this club are and for some time have been divided, the head-quarters proper being at the rooms of the Secretary, 178 Devonshire Street, and the stabling, lavatory, etc., on Boylston Street, three-fourths of a mile away. The procuring of suitable meeting-room, reading-room, dressing-room, and appropriate space for leaving and care of machines, all together and conveniently located, has heretofore been difficult to effect. In bringing up the subject at this time, one member proved his earnestness and interest in the club by offering to head a private subscription, in aid of the Treasurer's funds for that object, with fifty dollars. He was of course placed on the committee thereupon appointed, which consists of MM. E. C. Hodges, F. Butler, and J. S. Dean.<p>The Secretary laid before the club certain correspondence which had passed between him as Secretary of this club, and Mr. A. H. Curtis, Secretary of the National Association of Amateur Athletes of America, relative to the status of Mr. Will R. Pitman, of this city, as an amateur. The question comes before a committee of that association, by reference from the Union Athletic Club of Boston, on the 13th instant. Upon consideration of the correspondence and its subject-matter, the following vote was unanimously passed:<p>Voted, That our Secretary be directed to communicate to the Secretary of the National Association of Amateur Athletes, the respectful protest of this club against any adjudication which shall impose upon amateur clubs the courtesy or necessity of recognizing Mr. Will R. Pitman as an amateur, and to inform the Secretary that this club has as reasons for considering him a professional, the personal knowledge of its members of facts making him so under the rules of that association, a decision of a board of judges officially appointed by the City of Boston, after a hearing and under circumstances and so composed as to be entitled to respect, and also the apparent fact that, failing to make his claims to amateurship availing in Massachusetts, he has taken the matter to New York in an attempt to reinstate himself there, where it is difficult to produce the evidence, and to force himself upon the amateurs at home thereby.<p>MM. Geo. B. Woodward and W. W. Allen were appointed as committee on the part of this club to unite with a similar committee from the Mass. Bi. C. and arrange for a joint meet and two days' run during the month. It was also voted to have a meet and run of this club on Thanksgiving Day.<h2 id=brockton-bi-c>Brockton Bi.

This track was to be covered with a tent, and doubtless would have been but for the furious gale which was blowing during the closing days of the week, and which rendered the raising of a tent of such large proportions an impossibility. The managers then decided that they would postpone the 100-mile race, and begin a 6-days' race, of 10 hours each day, on Monday; but this plan, too, had to be given up, in deference to the elements, until finally it was determined to start a 4-days' race on Wednesday, Nov. 5, in which William Cann and Chas. Terront were to hold the track against all comers, and to allow any of such no less than 10 miles in every 100 miles, which might be covered. This bold challenge brought acceptances from Thos. Harrison (Boston); Prof. Rollinson (Philadelphia); Geo. Harrison (Boston); Murphy (Worcester); and Lowder (Somerville); each of whom appeared at the time appointed.<p>The Board of Judges were Messrs. C. E. Pratt, President Boston Bi. C.; Frank W. Weston, Secretary Boston Bi. C.; E. C. Hodges, Acting Captain Boston Bi. C.; and H. E. Parkhurst, Secretary Mass. Bi. C.<p>At 9:10 a.m. on the 5th, the men were sent off. The morning was cold and the air inside the tent chilly, so that the men settled down to their work at once in self-defence from the temperature.<p>The second day (Wednesday) brought a sprinkling of spectators, in spite of the falling snow, to see the start, which was effected promptly at 9 a.m., by Geo. Harrison, the other riders following as they got ready, up to 9:15, when all were on the track.<p>The third day (Thursday) brought clear skies and fine weather, and quite a large audience to see the start, which was made as usual, punctually at 9 a.m.<p>The closing day of the race brought settled fine weather and a large attendance of spectators, which, as evening approached, grew still larger until towards the finish it assumed proportions which must have been gratifying to the managers and the racers.<p>The following is the complete record of the distances covered by each rider:<table><thead><tr><th>Rider<th>Distance<tbody><tr><td>Terront, first<td>660 miles<tr><td>Cann, second<td>628 5/8 miles<tr><td>G.

Harrison taking respectively 1st, 2d, and 3d places.<p>The race was governed by the Wolverhampton rules, both Terront and Cann allowing the Americans ten miles in every hundred. Winners to cover the following distances to obtain prizes: 1st prize, $1,000, to cover 800 miles; 2d prize, $500, to cover 750 miles; 3d prize, $250, to cover 700 miles; 4th prize, $100, to cover 650 miles. The entries were as follows: Charles Terront, William Cann, Thomas Harrison, Geo. Harrison, R. S. Rollinson, Murphy, and Louder. As the event was the first professional race in this country when men of any note were entered, it was looked forward to with great interest by all friends of bicycling. The inclemency of the weather prevented many from witnessing the race, and the extreme cold of Wednesday and Thursday caused considerable suffering among the contestants. From the start, Terront and Cann took the lead and alternately held it until the finish, and it soon became evident that unless some serious accident occurred to either of them they would be easy winners. That fact once settled, the interest centred upon the occasional spurts between the men. Rollinson showed himself the fastest man on the track for a short distance, but taking into consideration both endurance and speed, Terront was by far his superior. This plucky little Frenchman finished second in the last 6 days' (18 hours).<h2 id=keen-vs-stanton-50-miles>Keen vs. Stanton, 50 Miles</h2><p>The same tent, or Bicycle Park as it is locally called, was the scene of a contest between John Keen and David Stanton, in a fifty-mile race, on Monday evening, the 10th inst.; this being the first of a series of competitions to last through the week, under the same management. Keen rode a 56-inch Eclipse, weighing 34 lbs., and Stanton rode a 56-inch Humber, of 35 lbs. weight. Stanton had a start of 2 laps, and the race was a very exciting one. We shall describe it more fully in our review of the week's events in our next issue; but give here the time made, as follows: Keen completed his 20th mile, 1h. 13m. 7s.; his 25th in 1h. 38m.

Our Detroit, provided as it is with miles of smooth wood pavements, affords facilities which not every city can boast of for bicyclers; and though when we wish to take long country rides we find Canada roads the smoothest and best adapted for riding, yet our 'cyclers find that an hour or two can be spent very enjoyably spinning along our streets. Some very pleasant rides have been made to the adjacent villages and towns by small parties of our riders.<p>The Captain of the Detroit Bi. Club, N. B. Conger, has so far made the longest one day's run in this vicinity. Starting from Windsor, at eight o'clock one morning, he made the run to Leamington and return, a distance of seventy miles. The actual running time, exclusive of stops, was seven hours and twenty minutes. Some parts of the run were made in good time, one twelve miles being accomplished in fifty minutes, and that against quite a stiff head-breeze. Moonlight rides are being indulged in these clear nights, and those who engage in them claim that it would be hard to get up a more enjoyable affair than a moonlight bicycle ride.<p>A gold medal for the club championship is being talked of, and no doubt at the next club meeting, to be held on Monday evening next, the talk will assume definite shape, and a race be arranged for.<p>I, for one, am sorry that it seems fated that bicycling, while yet in its infancy in our country, is to be taken hold of by the "sporting" and gambling fraternity, and used by them for their purposes, and thus degraded; for undoubtedly those who engage in it will soon descend to the level of the pedestrians, oarsmen, and other exponents of athletic exercises who have done so much to lower these sports in the estimation of all fair-minded lovers of them. The mention of any professional contest in either walking, running, rowing, or wrestling, brings at once to the mind the idea of fraud, and so dispels any interest that might arise were these affairs fair trials of strength, skill, or agility. It seems to have been clearly demonstrated of late that, where the winning or losing of large sums of money is at stake, the average degree of honesty found in the professional athlete is not proof against the temptation to resort to the fraud and trickery that will enable him to become possessed of what he deems his share of the money in the pool-box or otherwise at stake.<p>Bicycling, as a gentlemanly exercise, and for the sake of the healthful sport to be derived from it, is something that every lover of it should by all means in his power encourage; while bicycling, as an exhibition of what are called the staying powers and the going qualities of phenomenally endowed professionals, and the attendant gambling connected with such an exhibition, is something that every honest 'cycler ought to condemn. The importation of professionals ought to be discouraged by every means; and these contests that will be arranged for are not deserving of the notoriety that they receive from the press, nor of the patronage they get from the public. While there may be some honest men engaged in them, yet, on the whole, they will turn out to be money-making schemes, gambling frauds, and anything but exhibitions that will tend to elevate the morals of the masses, or beget a healthful interest in our noble sport. <strong>GO AS I PLEASE.</strong><h2 id=philadelphia-november-11-1879>Philadelphia, November 11, 1879</h2><p>Editor Bicycling World: - Most gladly do we welcome you to your place among the current literature of the day, and we feel full confidence that you will fill most acceptably your much-needed office.

We believe in the permanent future of the bicycle as a means of practical locomotion, as a delightful enabler to rational recreation and a health-preserver, as a refined and humane instrument of competitive athletics, and as the subject of a large and useful industry. We share in the generous social club spirit which it has awakened. We feel alive to the multitudinous interests, questionings, enjoyments, discoveries, and experiences arising out of the uses of the wheel, and we mean to voice them in our columns. If we interpret rightly the signs of the time there is a ripe demand for such a journal as ours proposes to be - impartial, accurate, tasteful, regular, comprehensive - not hitherto answered in this country. Entering upon this field as we do, with faith in our principal (but by no means exclusive) theme and in the good-will of the public to which we appeal, and founded upon a sound basis of funds and resources, we must yet bespeak that active<p>Since the eighteenth issue of The American Bicycling Fournal went to press, it and its tangible properties have been transferred to the proprietors of this paper, and it will appear no more. With pluck and generosity of time and means, the sanguine editor of the Fournal took it from a premature and precarious foundation as the exponent of an importing firm, and has carried it through a career beset with difficulties so far towards success. Under his unique and familiar heading he makes at this time on our opposite page a parting bow. Our readers will be glad to know that he does not thereby quit the field he has graced so well, and that his ready pen will continue to contribute to the columns of the WORLD, of which he will be an associate editor. While this paper is in no sense a continuation of that, and has no connection with it except by purchase and absorption, we hope the favor it has received and the influences which have aided it will in future be accorded to ours, and that we may merit them as well.<h2 id=the-sixty-hour-race>The Sixty-Hour Race</h2><p>As to the value of professional contests to the best interests of bicycling, there is an open question. Our correspondent in another column makes some strictures on that phase of the sport, drawn chiefly, no doubt, from his observation of other athletic competitions, from which it is but just to say that the sixty-hour race in Boston last week was mostly free.<p>This race is of peculiar interest in several aspects. It was the first protracted bicycling contest in America, and was participated in not only by five of our home professionals, but by two of the twelve best riders in the world. The latter have been years acquiring their skill and power and adding to their accomplishments. The former were comparatively novices; most of them with little previous experience, with no careful training, without adequate care and attendance during the race, with no prior test of their ability or endurance to gauge their efforts by through so many consecutive hours, with heavier machines, they had many disadvantages and much to learn. These considerations were offset in whole or in part by the ten per cent. odds allowed them, so far as winning was concerned, but in any comparison of their riding they need to be borne in mind. As a great race it was a failure. The failure began with those who undertook to prepare the track and the tent; the track was too narrow by four or five feet, and neither the walk nor the tent was in ready condition for the start, though the public had already been four times deceived and disappointed by advertised engagements that they should be so. No wonder that the attendance was not large. Then the wind and snow and cold of an exceptionally cruel and severe November opening made it chilling and even dangerous for both the public and the competitors. Muffled in coats and flannels, numb to sleepiness, seized with cramps and bruised by falls, they were plucky fellows to ride at all during the first three days; and on the fourth day they loafed. They did not ride the full time at all; they toyed with their bouquets, chatted with their chums and lady friends, and an hour before their time expired, when all were in a cheerful condition for making many miles more, all the Americans were off the track, the Englishman was smoking a cigar, and looking up "Jack" and "Dave," and the Frenchman was whistling and singing along for a few laps more, - his music being much more entertaining than the fitful and feeble attempts of the band had been. Looking at it as a whole it was almost a farce; and yet many of the scenes and incidents were pretty and even brilliant. On comparing the aggregate distances and time with those in recent long races abroad, the result is favorable neither to the foreigners nor to the Americans. The fastest miles look better for both; Terront's 3.10 and Cann's 3.21 being not only creditable for them in so long a race, but leaving T. Harrison's 3.12 and Rollinson's 3.13 much more creditable under the circumstances. Rollinson displayed the utmost grace in riding, and G. Harrison showed that he has the pluck and the power to contend well with the best when he has eaten more steaks and learned how to put himself in training.<p><img alt=header src=/images/the-bicycling-world/vol1-1/_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg><h2 id=the-king-is-dead-long-live-the-king>The King Is Dead, Long Live The King!</h2><p>Nearly two years ago (Dec., 1877) the initial number of the "American Bicycling Journal" made its bow to a constituency of six riders, and a contingent of possibly a few hundreds of readers. To-day, with a constituency of some thousands of riders, and of readers an unknown quantity, it gracefully resigns its personality, and becomes merged in the stronger enterprise, of the initial number of which it forms a part. We may perhaps as well confess that it is not without some sentimental regret that we take this action; but the regret is akin to that with which the father beholds his boy entering upon the manhood which is to free him from the parental care, and is swallowed up in the exultation with which we regard our bantling publication, introduced in the face of an apathy and ignorance as to our sport, so dense as almost to constitute opposition, now so universally appreciated, that the talent and the capital which have heretofore been lacking in our enterprise have so soon been found and enrolled in the cause of our glorious sport.<p>We need not recapitulate the disadvantages under which we have labored in the production of the past eighteen numbers of our "Journal," for we have unfortunately had too frequently to refer to them in its columns. We prefer rather to point with pride to the fact, that in spite of all these opposing forces we have met with such encouragement and right hearty good-will and assistance from our readers that we have been enabled to produce thereby in all nearly sixty thousand copies, comprising some eight hundred thousand pages, of a "Journal," which, however glaring its faults and deficiencies may have been, must of necessity have carried some information and influence with it wherever it circulated.<p>In the beginning our work was necessarily largely of a missionary character. In this country the bicycle was a new, an untried experiment, and our earlier issues found ample field for the dissemination of facts proving its practicability as an instrument of enjoyable locomotion. This necessity, however, did not last for a great while. The energy and enterprise of our manufacturing and importing houses in the bicycle trade soon spread the news that the tireless horse stood ready to the people's hand, and we began to perceive unmistakable indications that the bulk of our readers would not long remain contented with the reiteration of facts proving what to them, at least, was as stale news as would have been the statement that a loaf of bread was good to eat.<p>Then came the time for the incorporation of new features in our work, so that while it should still be of interest and attractiveness to the novice and the tyro, the rapidly increasing army of experts should be supplied with the facts which they, too, needed, and that the record of American Bicycling should be complete in all its departments. To the accomplishing of this end we at once bent our energies, and although the effort was for some time attended with serious pecuniary loss we continued to persevere - with what success we leave our readers to determine - until at last the constantly increasing interest in our publication assumed such proportions as to ensure its stability and permanence.<p>We thus briefly touch upon the past of the first venture in bicycling journalism, so that our readers may the more easily comprehend the motives which have actuated us in our arrangements for the future.<p>Bicycling has attained already, in this country, such proportions that it is no longer possible for individual effort to produce an organ which shall worthily and creditably occupy the immense field before it; to do this, collective enterprise, energy, and ability have become absolute necessities. We have therefore allied ourselves with two gentlemen, each well known as earnest advocates of our sport, as well as skilful exponents of its utility.<p>Our publication under the old title has, in meeting its many adversities, been so frequently compelled to temporarily succumb, that a certain reputation for irregularity has become attached to it. This irregularity is no longer necessary, nor will it in future be permitted.<p>In the conduct of our bantling "Journal," we have said and written and done such as lay within the scope of our ability; but for the same reasons that the skipper of a river-steamer would surrender the wheel to more able hands in a voyage and on a craft "which ploughs the ocean," so we in our joint proprietorship of a paper which we aim to make superior to most, and second to none, of the ventures on the field of bicycling journalism, surrender the reins of editorial management, and shall rest supremely content if in our "associate" capacity we can say or write or do aught to forward the common cause of both the readers and the proprietors of this paper.<p>To our old subscribers we would say that we have not neglected their interests, and that the first eight numbers of the new paper, making in all the twenty-six numbers which we have promised them, will be forwarded as usual, and without extra cost, as issued.<p>To our old readers, and to the many friends of whose sympathy and regard we have received substantial tokens, we would tender our grateful thanks, not less for their kindness than for their forbearance, and would assure them that under the new regime we shall continue our best efforts in the interests which it has been, and will continue to be, our aim to advance.<p><strong>F.

After the evidence against them was all in, the jury was instructed to return a verdict of not guilty, and the defendants were acquitted. How the verdict was received by their neighbors appears in "Our Exchanges," in another column.

This is the true type of velocipede for practical use, and is in great favor with our English and French cousins, especially the former, where many clubs are already formed for the encouragement and enjoyment of it, and where races are had with it. It is a sister of the bicycle, and is the suitable counterpart for the use of the bicycler's sister, or wife, or lady friend, who may wish to accompany him before she has courage to adopt a dress which will admit of her mounting the better and more fascinating wheel. More patents are issued in England, of late, for improvements in bicycles in a month than for bicycles in a year, and perfection is not so nearly reached. We shall chronicle some of the events with them and describe some of their improvements in construction.<p>Nor shall we be unmindful of the velocipede made for the little fellows, the making of which is so large an industry, and the use of which is so healthful and conducive to good riding in the same boys after a larger growth. In fact we shall count nothing altogether foreign to us which pertains to that multiform mechanical contrivance, the driven and supporting wheel.<h1 id=our-exchanges>Our Exchanges</h1><p>" The indispensable sex." - If any daring person inquires why ladies cannot ride the bicycle, he must address the inquiry not to Nature, which has interposed no objection, but to the same irrational conventionalism which has decreed to the female equestrian an ungraceful, inconvenient side-saddle and a trailing robe that make her helpless while in her seat and endanger her life as soon as unseated. True, she rides, but in spite of these obstacles - by dint of her wit and innate gracefulness; so she walks - on narrow soles and French heels. Give her - or, rather, let her dare to take - for the occasion, not that terrible bloomer, but some modification of sensible gymnasium or short dress, and she will quickly adapt it to satisfy all requirements of delicacy and grace, and will thus be able to mount this swift steed now a-waiting her - a steed which fits well enough the Nature-woman, but cannot make itself to fit skirt-civilization. The male biped will not willingly leave her behind on his multipedal steed, nor will she long consent to be left. - 7. Wilcox, in November Lippincott's.<h3 id=the-bicyclers-acquitted>The Bicyclers Acquitted.</h3><p>No Case Found Against The Members Of The Brockton Club.<p>As most of our readers well remember, five of the members of the Brockton Bicycle Club have been anxiously awaiting the decision of the Superior Court on their appeal from the sentence of Judge Keith, of the Second District Court, who thought that indulging in 'cycle riding on Sunday was a violation of a chapter of the General Statutes, and accordingly fined five of them $10 and one-fifth of the costs each. The circumstances of the case, so well known to our readers, were such that the boys were confident of innocence, and the interest excited by the result of the first trial has been very wide, every owner of a 'cycle in the State awaiting the result with impatience. Yesterday the four young men - one having paid the fine because of a removal from town - went down to Plymouth with much apprehension, for, although they felt almost sure that they would be acquitted, the uncertainty of the law is proverbial, and there is no way of correctly prophesying the result of a suit in court. A telegram received at the ADVANCE office last evening, however, says the verdict of Judge Keith is not correct; that they are not guilty; in fact that Judge Wilkerson has decided that there is no case against them, and that they can hereafter ride as freely upon Sunday as upon any other day in the week. This result will be hailed with triumph, not only by the bicycle interest, who have all the time thought that bicycle riding was not amenable to the so-called Sunday law (practically a defunct one), but by every one who loves square dealing and to whom the conduct of Fitzgibbons, in instituting a criminal suit against the young men because they would not pay the extortionate amount asked by him for damage done to his vehicle because of the frightening of his horse by the " steel horses," has appeared in a most unfavorable light. His little plan of instituting a civil suit against the young men if the criminal one was successful will now be nipped in the bud, and he, as well as the judge who imposed the sentence, will not be the recipients of a high degree of affection from any fair-minded man who has followed the case from the first. - Brockton Advance.<h1 id=glances-abroad>Glances Abroad</h1><h3 id=keen-v-stanton-100-miles>Keen v.

It is published regularly on alternate Saturday mornings, in issues of not less than three thousand copies, and its actual circulation is more than two thousand copies an issue. No part of this large and rapidly increasing circulation is thrown away; but it is founded on an annual subscription list already large and rapidly extending, on sales at news-stands, agencies, and races, and on a carefully selected and strictly interested "specimen-copy" list. It goes, to the extent of two thousand copies and upwards, to the hands and eyes of a young, active, and enterprising constituency, by which it is read, passed around, preserved, and made permanent for reference; it is not confined to bicyclers only, nor to the passing notice and loss of circulars, nor to the fleeting and hurried uses of newspapers.
