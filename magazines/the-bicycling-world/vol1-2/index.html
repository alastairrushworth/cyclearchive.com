They might be good diet for some of our wheelmen who spring to saddle à la Terront, or who have a Keen appetite.<p>Our thanks are due to Rockwood Hoar, Esq., who so ably defended Mr. Brown, for an account from which we have prepared our Court Report in this number.<p>That piece of Jugglery in verse is from our Jersey correspondent, who is not, however, a descendant of the late lamented Jonathan Juggs, Esq.<p>The Crimson says, "The bicycle races bid fair to take a permanent place among our college sports." We are waiting to know how The Yale Record views it.<p>It is a long way from the quiver to the target, and skill in sending the true arrow comes only by practice; but we will hope to hit the gold at least once a fortnight and make a goodly score by the end of the year.<p>"After Dark in Boston" is a current subject with the Globe now. It has been one with bicyclers ever since the diminished burners were put on the street lights. Three stars and a new moon suffice to make these lesser flames cast shadows. We heartily second the Courier in condemning this mock economy of three-foot burners where the lights are so far apart and the price of gas has been so much reduced.<p>"I like your paper," said Mrs. Pinipucker to us the other day, - "it's a complete bicyclopædia."<p>"Half of an interview with John Keen" is only one of the interesting things left over for want of space in this number. Like competitors in other athletic fields, we are limited by the rules of the -- pages.<p>Cycling asks: Was it Tom Hood who wrote the lines on this dreary month, complaining about there being<blockquote><p>"No travelling at all - no locomotion -<br> No inkling of the way - no notion -<br> No go" - by land or ocean.<br> No bicycling, no tricycling.<br> No comfortable feel in any member,<br> No - vember!"</blockquote><p>Each on his narrow seat of porcine hide,<br> The gay forefathers of the future ride.<h2 id=an-interview-with-john-keen>An Interview With John Keen.</h2><p>Unquestionably the most interesting bicycling character who has visited us from abroad is Mr. John Keen, - or "Happy Jack," as his countrymen familiarly speak of him, - the English professional, now in Chicago. His graceful and effective style of riding, his frank and honorable deportment, gain him friends everywhere; while his long experience both as a maker and a rider of the bicycle, and his brilliant record on the racing path, have made him not only well known to those who have never seen him, but also an authority from whom wisdom may be drawn.<p>Believing that something from him would especially interest the readers of the BICYCLING WORLD at this time, a representative of this paper waited upon Mr. Keen, at his hotel in Boston, on 16 November, and requested a conversation for publication. He appeared somewhat unfamiliar with the American invention of "interviewing," but gave a very courteous reception, and the substance of his conversation follows, in a condensed form, with many questions left out, as well as some of his replies:<p>I began the manufacture of bicycles on my own account in 1870, and made racers and roadsters, the registered name of which is "Keen's Eclipse." Amongst the improvements in style and construction which I have been the first to introduce, are the centre steering-head with cone centres, in 1871, roller-bearings, the direct spoke, the hollow fork, - I made this latter in 1876, in flattened tubular form almost a true oval. The single hollow fork is still the best, the double hollow fork being, in my opinion, less rigid and weaker, and merely a trade catch. I was also first with the lever brake on front.<h3 id=the-clubs-reviewed>The Clubs Reviewed</h3><h4 id=hartford-bicycle-club>Hartford Bicycle Club</h4><p>It is just one year ago this month that the first bicycle made its appearance in the streets of Hartford, Conn. Month after month showed some new votaries to this most delightful of exercises; and when the spring was fairly upon us we could count a dozen riders. About this time a great deal was said concerning the formation of a club, but there seemed to be somebody wanting in the necessary executive ability, or in interest enough to go ahead, and we dallied along till fall before anything more was said about a club. Meanwhile, during the summer, a great many new riders had made their appearance on the streets, and the old ones had developed into fine riders, notably R. C. Wander, who, with Mr. Arthur Eddy, between the heats of the trotting match at the county fair at Charter Oak Park, went around the first mile in 3.45; when they had finished the first mile, Mr. Eddy, supposing Wander was going to stop, dismounted, while Wander kept on, making his second mile in 3.21; being timed by the judges of the day. Mr. Wander also made his half mile recently in 1.32. We also have other fine riders, such as Clark Lawrence, who, with Mr. Price, have just returned from a trip to Vermont, they going the whole distance on their machines.<p>In response to a call to the riders in this city, to have a meet on Saturday, the 4th Oct., 1879, thirteen came. The run was from the corner of Washington street and Capitol avenue to New Britain and return; distance, twenty miles; roads rather hilly and extremely dusty. The start was at 1.15 p.m. and at the signal the line moved off in double file. In an hour and a half New Britain was reached without any serious mishaps, except having to wait for those inexperienced ones, who were necessarily getting "croppers."<p>The stay in New Britain was only long enough to have some photographs taken (through the kindness of Mr. Olmsted, one of the riders), when the signal to return was given, and from that time till the riders reached Hartford, it was a hard pull for first place. The first hill that was descended on the way back succeeded in throwing our Chinese rider, "Chang," so as to compel him to seek some other mode of reaching home, as the backbone of his machine was badly bent. The first to arrive home were the trio, Wander, T. Harrison, the well-known professional, and Arthur Eddy; time, 50 minutes; then came E. Copeland, R. Perry, and Will Howard; these three also came in a bunch time, 55 minutes.<p>After this meet the bicyclers of Hartford saw the necessity of forming a club, and steps were at once taken in that direction, some of which have been reported in the columns of the Bicycling World. Our club is now established, with twenty-two members, and has every prospect of success.

P., who knows from experience, says that an abrupt dismount is much more likely to frighten a horse than is remaining in the saddle and speaking to the animal. Also, "I am not surprised at the small number of accidents.

Y., 12th Nov., 1879. Editor of The Bicycling World : -</h3><p>Dear Sir, - For some time past the excellent macadams reported to us as intersecting and lying between the various small townships in that part of New Jersey bordering New York City had occupied the serious attention of the Brooklyn Bicycle Club; but it was only last week that decided action was taken to put them to the test. In response to a call for a day's run in that locality, on election day, six members put in an appearance at the meet, which, as arranged, was upon the Brooklyn Wharf of the Annex Ferry to Pavonia, at 8 a.m. We were aware that whenever we landed in Jersey City a somewhat long and tedious jaunt through the poorly paved streets of that slatternly town was inevitable. We learned, however, that Pavonia was the most favorable landing from which to reach the good macadam high road to Newark, our first objective point. A strong and bitterly cold wind was blowing, and for the first time this winter our wheels passed over ice; but we soon confirmed the fact that a low temperature need be no detriment to the bicycler, providing everything else is favorable, for we had hardly got well into action before our finger tips and noses contained the only chilled blood in our bodies, and soon these extremities participated in the general glow, from which our spirits soon caught the infection.<p>It took us perhaps half an hour, part riding and part walking, to reach what is thereabouts known as the "plank road" to Newark. This road, however, is actually a fine smooth macadam, perfectly level and really excellent riding, continuing rather more than three and one-half miles over the "Jersey Flats." As may be imagined the route here is not interesting as far as scenic effects are concerned; but, given a good road, what further poetry does a bicycler need than that of his own motion? As we neared Newark trees edged the road and happily shut out the dreary waste of landscape beyond and at the same time lent us welcome shade from the wind.<p>On our way across Newark we had again the unpleasant option of cobblestones or sidewalk for fully a mile. At length we reached Central Avenue, the splendid highway from Newark to Orange. We were not disappointed in this much lauded avenue; although not so rigidly level it was even smoother and better riding than that which had satisfied us so well into Newark. Well made and kept, it had the additional advantage of running through a piece of landscape in refreshing contrast to that behind us, and part of its beauty lies in its undulating character. Nor were the gradual inclines troublesome to us even with a strong head wind, and every rider knows what that involves. At Grove Street we deviated somewhat from our direct route and visited a friend at East Orange. We were surprised to find the cross road equally as good as the avenue, and as we traversed their smooth surfaces we marvelled that our fascinating sport had not taken hold more generally in that part of Jersey.<p>Retracing our tracks we were soon in the core of the town of Orange primus, some two and one-half miles from Grove Street, and here we halted again for visiting purposes.<h2 id=to-be-continued>[To Be Continued.]</h2><h2 id=club-doings>Club Doings</h2><h3 id=bangor-bi-c>"Bangor Bi.

"There is no club organization here now. Some eight bicyclers are in the city who have machines, but each rides for himself. Sometimes three or four make excursions into the country, thirty miles or more. The best riders are H. E. Bliss and Mr. Buck, the latter riding daily."</ul><h3 id=chauncey-hall-bi-c>Chauncey Hall Bi. C.</h3><ul><li>On Monday, 10 Nov. 1879, a bicycle club was formed by members of the Chauncey Hall School in Boston, Mass., with a list of twelve members, and officers as follows: Pres't and Captain, J. G. Coolidge; Sub-Captain, W. S. Tufts; Sec'y and Treas., F. R. Miller, 750 E. Fourth Street, South Boston, Mass.</ul><h3 id=crescent-bi-c>Crescent Bi.

The club colors are gold, silver, and blue. The meetings are held at the St. James Hotel in Boston, and, as last reported, the number of members is twelve.</ul><h3 id=hartford-bi-c>Hartford Bi.

It also adopted blue as the club color, and a badge in the form of a shield to hang from a pin; those for officers to have their rank marked on the pin.</ul><h3 id=salem-bi-c>Salem Bi.

They were joined at Lynn by several members of the Lynn Bi. C., and one of the Mass. Bi. C., and after a forenoon full of amusing incidents and adventures they enjoyed a dinner at the Medford House, "to which the company did such ample justice that nothing but the table furniture was observable at the close."

The weather was kinder, the attendance and enthusiasm of spectators was greater, and the contests were of character and quality at once more entertaining and more instructive.<p>As they were carefully and racily written up in the Boston Herald and the other daily papers, however, I shall only give in this report a summary, which may serve as a record of the events of this second and last week of the visit of our courteous and accomplished foreign visitors and the few Americans who went upon the track during that time.<p>The events are given in the order in which they occurred, as follows:<ol><li><p>Monday, 10 Nov., at 7.30 p.m., Keen v.

W. Allen, Boston Bicycle Club, victim of what our English cousins would call "a nasty cropper," at the same race, has nearly recovered from his injury, and claims that he was compelled to choose between two fouls. He learned one or two things, too. He is one of the fleetest and longest riders on the roads, but has been singularly unfortunate on the racing path the few times he has entered.<h2 id=mr-w-w-stall>Mr. W. W. Stall</h2><p>Mr. W. W. Stall, who showed so much ability in the recent five-mile handicap amateur race in Boston, rode a machine too small for him, and on an empty stomach, which he says was "like a bass-drum - empty and large." He learned something to profit by in that race, as did several others.<h2 id=mr-w-s-tufts>Mr. W. S. Tufts</h2><p>Mr. W. S.

Also, if I may be allowed to select the course, I will run one mile against any trotting horse. Inasmuch as my best solo - I will 1:23, I will make a match only with reasonable odds in my favor - say, $400 to $100. Address<p><strong>John Keen, Bicycler, Boston Herald Office.

Fairfield and Beach on the first grand over-night company run in September last. Perhaps the developments of that occasion hastened the formation of our Hartford sister organization.<h2 id=mr-j-c-thompson>Mr. J. C. Thompson</h2><p>Mr. J. C. Thompson, of New Haven, Conn., is building a large rink expressly for the use of bicyclers this winter. It is to be 150 × 75 feet, and to have two tracks, one for learners and one for riders.<p>The same enterprising gentleman has opened an agency for bicycles in Springfield, Mass., and will probably give the people of that vicinity all the bicycles they will take.<h2 id=mr-frank-w-weston>Mr. Frank W. Weston</h2><p>Mr. Frank W. Weston, Boston Bi. C., whose fertile mind and ready hand has designed so many attractive things for bicyclers, has connived with a skilful hatter, and produced a unique and tasteful felt helmet, which is looked on favorably, as a choice pattern for adoption, by representatives of two clubs already. It is a good thing, and needs only to be examined to be approved.<hr><h2 id=bicycling-excursion>Bicycling Excursion</h2><p>The following must be a Spiritism; we clip it, however, and trust some one will rise to explain, or take a hint to give us the true facts, in future, in advance:<p>Nov. 16, a dozen Metropolitan bicyclists assembled at corner Fifty-ninth street and Eighth avenue, bound for Yonkers positively, and Tarrytown probably. Some came to grief at obstinate curbstones, others tumbled, pell-mell, down Carmansville Hill, and piled themselves in a confused heap on the One Hundred and Twenty-fifth street railroad tracks. One machine broke down at Kingsbridge, and the village blacksmith spent three hours in repairs, and finally all but four of the starters reached Yonkers about two hours later than they could have arrived by walking, and returned to New York City by railroad.<hr><h2 id=correspondence>Correspondence</h2><h3 id=kol-kron-writes>Kol Kron Writes</h3><p>Kol Kron writes: "The New York Park Commissioners gave orders 15 Nov., that all bicycles and velocipedes should be excluded from the broad sidewalks which bound the Park on the south (59th st.) and east (5th ave.) sides. These vehicles, however, are still allowed on the 8th ave. walk (which bounds the Park on the west), and on the other sidewalks of the city."<h3 id=a-correspondent-at-yonkers>A Correspondent at Yonkers</h3><p>A correspondent at Yonkers, N. Y., writes under date of 1, Nov.: "Our riding school here is just finishing its fourth week, and has turned out at least forty riders. I take a class twice a week on the road - we go to-morrow to Tarrytown and return. I use a 52-in., and do all my travelling with it, never less than five miles a day, and begin to feel quite at home with it. Neither snow nor rain has yet kept me indoors."<h3 id=a-back-window-view>A Back-Window View</h3><p>A Philadelphia correspondent gives us a glance at a local club thus: "Last evening [a certain] Bi. C. met at Horticultural Hall and had a rehearsal of the bugle calls, one of the members supplying the bugle and playing it, while the sub-captain 'called' the figures. Things went pretty smoothly, until both captain and bugler played it on us. The bugler playing something, we know not what, and the captain failing to explain, the boys were nonplussed; some dismounted, some attempted to form twos, others quickened pace, and there was a general mixture for a while, that was rather ludicrous. This portion of the drill was, of course, warmly applauded by the unattached."<hr><h2 id=our-new-york-letter>Our New York Letter</h2><h3 id=new-york-nov-13-1879>New York, Nov. 13, 1879</h3><p>A review of the past season shows us many encouraging signs of progress for our favorite steed, in this section, - a section in which strong popular prejudice and natural topographical difficulties unite to retard it. The large majority of thoroughfares in New York are unridable, and the authorities have, with inexplicable antagonism, forbidden the use of the remainder. Riding in Central Park is positively interdicted, while in Brooklyn the superb asphalt pavements are only available at night and in early morning.<hr><h2 id=in-prospect-park>In Prospect Park</h2><p>The far-seeing commissioners allow the indiscriminate use of the crowded walk, without bell, brake, or restriction as to speed. But the roadway, the legitimate place for all vehicles, is denied. Riders being forced to dismount in crossing one. In Jersey, bicyclers are more highly favored, especially in Essex and Hudson counties, where hundreds of miles of perfect roads and unrestricted liberty afford the height of bicyclic enjoyment. No meets of special importance have taken place. The Essex and Brooklyn Clubs had a fine joint run to Brighton, and both clubs have given many regular runs during the season.<p>There have been about a dozen races in New York and vicinity this year, given mostly by athletic clubs in their regular meetings. The universal American complaint of poor tracks resulted in many of them being mere exhibitions of muscle, not speed; but a few have shown records which are certainly not disgraceful, considering our in- That of most importance was, of fancy in the sport. course, the fight for the amateur championship, a report of which appeared in the late American Bicycling Journal. To Mr. S. B. Pomeroy, M. A C., E. Bi. C., fell the honor of lowering the American two-mile record below seven minutes. He having run that distance in 6.593. He has also won several other races in very creditable time. The amateur champion, Mr. L. H. Johnson, E. Bi. C., has won nine first, and three second prizes in the fifteen races in which he has contested. Messrs. Knight, Field, Lawson, Bellman, and Noeille, have distinguished themselves upon the racing path this season, and many others will doubtless join the ranks next spring. The 72-hour professional race was such a palpable fraud as to be undeserving of notice in these pages. Suffice it to say that the official score showed astonishing bursts of speed on the part of the projectors and winners (?) of the race. For example: 10 miles in 19 minutes. A young Irishman, just come from England, claims a record of 2.54 for the mile, and to have beaten East with 70 yards' start. His demeanor soon caused him to be protested as a professional, which protest is now in the hands of the National Association.<p>The great need of bicycling New York is a suitable path for racing, and it is probable that one will be constructed during the next season. A macadam track, 3 laps to the mile, with raised corners, is a project under the consideration of the Essex Bicycle Club. It would be situated in or near Newark, 30 minutes from New York, and accessible from it by four lines of rail and a superb macadam road.<p>Gotham extends to the Bicycling World its heartiest greeting. May it live forever is the wish of IXION.<hr><h2 id=jack-easy-s-letter>Jack Easy's Letter</h2><p><strong>Complimentary.</strong> - The old Journal. - The Transatlantic Team. - The Tent and the Track. - The Proposed New Boston Tracks. - The Winter Season, Its Probabilities, Its Opportunities, Its Enjoyments. - Sleighs Versus Bicycles. - Don't Defer. - Learn to Ride Now.<p>BosTON, 24 November, 1879.<p>Editor of the Bicycling World: -<p>Permit an occasional correspondent to the intermittent but not therefore less valued old Journal to express some of his gratification at the appearance of the first number of the bright, newsy, and attractive WORLD, not long since received, and just perused, from the antique title-heading to the last word of the final advertisement. Knowing how prone editors are to blushing, I will forbear writing the many complimentary comments which are at my pen's end, but must say that I think you will find it difficult to substantiate your statement on your first page, which reads " nor is the BICYCLING WORLD perfected in one number." I don't quite accept your assertion that the WORLD is in no sense a continuation of the Journal, because to me, at all events, it will be a continuation of it in every sense. As a record of American Bicycling the one will certainly not be complete without the other, and I hope in the future to see the bound volume of the one side by side with the others in my book-case, each giving me, in its completeness, all of information and of interest which I cannot find in the other.<p>But I must not make my first letter a commentary on the paper it is written for, nor on the views or statements of its owners, so I will dismiss this part of my theme by hoping that all there was of good, of enterprise, and of success in the old Journal may be indeed continued in the new WORLD; that it may reach us regularly and permanently, and that it may circulate wherever " the wheel " goes round.<p>Of course the topic among bicyclers in this city has been the visit of the transatlantic champions. In common with all the wheelmen, I have been a constant attendant at the races and exhibitions which they have given at the Back Bay tent, and with each visit I have become more ashamed of the mean accommodations and opportunities which the Hub has afforded them for the display of their skill and endurance. First of all, a tent! November, too, and snowing at that, so that during the mornings of the sixty-hour race, the unique spectacle of bicycling athletes whirling round, clad in great coats and thick gloves, was to be beheld by the shivering spectators. No wonder that the "gate," for the first half of the day, at all events, hardly paid for the keeping. And then the track, - eight laps, with semicircular end struck from a thirty-feet radius, and a width of ten feet. It speaks well for the fairness of the contestants that any rider was allowed to pass another at all, and well, too, for their ability, that even 3.10 was accomplished. How Jack Keen, with his 2.46 record, must have fretted when he found himself utterly unable to let himself out, or even to approach his average. But in Chicago, whither the team are now bound, I am told there is a building in which can be laid a four-lap track of ample width, and with easy corners, and I shall hope in an early issue of the WORLD to read that our visiting riders have been afforded an opportunity to display some of the capabilities of the modern wheel, which this country has not yet given to them. In the mean time, the project to build, in this city, a five-lap track, twenty-five feet wide, roofed over and enclosed in a permanent building, should be supported by all who have any influence in that direction. Even those who are not interested in bicycling should become interested in this, for such a building would provide an auditorium some 470 feet long and 200 feet wide, which could be covered, when needed, with a movable floor, and would afford seats for an audience of some 10,000 persons. With such a building, the orators of the coming political year would find their labors made.<hr><p>[29 Nov., 1879<h2 id=proposed-track-at-granite-bridge>Proposed Track at Granite Bridge</h2><p>Talking of tracks, I am somewhat disappointed at not finding any mention of the proposed track at Granite Bridge, in the number of the WORLD before me. I feel a good deal interested in this project, so much so, that I have been out on my wheel to the proposed location, and have come back heartily in favor of it. I think it would be hard to find a better site. It is level and smooth, lays on a solid bed of gravel, contains ample space for a three-lap track; is bounded on one side by the Neponset river, which affords capital facilities for boating, canoeing, and swimming; is close to two railway stations, near to a line of horse-cars, and for access by means of the "wheel," from anywhere in Boston, - except, perhaps, Chelsea, - it cannot be surpassed, as splendid roads lead to it from every direction. With real estate down to low-water mark, there will never be another chance to buy such a spot at so low a figure, and I hope not only that you will support the scheme with your pen, but that it may go through. If the wheel interest is not strong enough to subscribe the needed capital, some capitalist who is, can surely be found, and he most certainly would never regret taking hold, though we wheelmen, to whom is now given the opportunity, just as certainly should.<p>I was sorry to see, a few days back, an announcement in the columns of the Boston Transcript that "bicycling is over for the season." The item appeared on Friday, and was probably written during the snow-storm of the night previous; but during the day the snow disappeared, the roads dried up, and on the next day, Saturday, I took one of the most delightful ten-mile spins I have had since last winter. The roads were smooth and hard as flint, the bracing north-west wind added a keener zest to the enjoyment of rapid motion, and as I sped along I could not help thinking how much better it would be if editors were to forbear expressing opinions as to our sport until after they had qualified themselves to enjoy it. The fact is, our season - far from being over - is just commencing. We are in some danger of temporary interruptions from snow, to be sure, but the probabilities, judging from past winters, are, that of the men who own bicycles and the men who own sleighs, the former will have the balance of opportunities in their favor. The Transcript is deservedly one of the most popular of newspapers, and as such is powerful for good or otherwise when it editorially expresses an opinion. The item I have referred to may have deterred some of its readers from attempting to master the wiry steed until the opening of spring, but I would ask such to take the advice of an old rider, and to join our noble order at once. "Procrastination is the thief of time," and in their case, of the onnobling pleasures and healthful enjoyments which now are ready to their hands.<hr><h2 id=race-results>Race Results</h2><p>At the end of the first day the score stood: Stanton 174, Cann 170, Terront 125, Keen 93; Meyer 265, Velard 256, G.

Excepting On More Southern Parallels, However, All Through December, January, And February, The Bicycle Must He Substantially Housed.<p>The Enthusiastic Wheelman Will Not Be Contented To Forego His Exercise, For That He Will Need To Keep Him In Good Condition And Cheerfulness; Nor His Recreation With The Cherished Pedalifer, For He Does Not Wish To Lapse Into Inexpertness, Or To Be Unready To Seize The Opportunities As They Offer, Either During The Winter Or The Early Spring. Several Of The Clubs Have Already Provided At Head-Quarters, Or Arranged With Local Ridingschools, Or Owners Of Unoccupied Halls, Suitable Places For Keeping Machines And For Their Indoor Use. Where There Are Yet No Clubs The Agents Have In Some Cases Opened Riding-Halls For The Winter, For The Double Purpose Of Teaching New Learners And Of Accommodating Old Riders.<p>Wherever A Floor Forty Feet By Sixty, Or Larger, Can Be Obtained In A Suitable Location, It Ought By All Means To Be Secured. Winter Is The Best Time For Learn-The Cool Air Braces Up The Museles And The Nerves. Ing. The Greater Activity And Pluck Called Forth By The Season Enable To Confidence. There Is Less Temptation To Long Road Rides Before Mastery Of The Steed. Again, For The Old Rider There Are Almost Infinite Capabilities Of Use And Performance And Sleight Of Limb With This Instrument Of Athletic Development, Which He Can Nowhere And At No Time So Well Pursue, And Which Will Amply Repay His Experimenting For The Daily Or Twice-Weekly Hour Which He May Be Able To Devote To Them.<p>If Those Who Are Interested In The Sale Of Bicycles, And In Teaching The Use Of Them, Are Awake To Their Own Best Opportunities, They Will Cooperate Promptly And Liberally With The Riders In Their Own Localities Toward The Ends Here Suggested. From Our Observation Of Things Bicyclic During The Past Two Years, We Believe That The Number Of Riders In November Will Be Doubled For March.<h2 id=concerning-learners>CONCERNING LEARNERS</h2><p>We May Observe That There Are At Present Two Classes Of Them In This Country. Each Has Difficulties To Contend With, And Much Wisdom To Gain From Experience; And To Each We Shall Hope To Offer Suggestions Of Some Value, From Time To Time, Drawn From Our Own And From Other Sources Of Observation And Reflection. First, There Are The Learners To Ride; And There Are Probably Ten Of Them To One Bicycler. It Stood, As A Learned Quotation From Antiquity, On The Title-Page Of The Grammar We Studied At School, "The Rudiments Of Every Art Must Be Taken As A Task, Not As An Amusement." Watch The Man With A Foot-Lathe, A Sewing-Machine, Or A Pair Of Scales, For The First Few Times, And See What Hard Work It Is To Him. So With A Bicycle, The Man Finds It At First Difficult To Attend To Hands And Feet At The Same Time; He Instinctively Grasps The Handles With A Tiresome Effort To Hold Himself On - Which He Soon Learns He Can No More Do Than To Lift Himself By His Boot-Straps; It Bothers Him To Make Hands Of His Feet And Keep Them To Their Duty On The The Pedals; See How Hard He Works To Resist Every Motion Of The Machine But The Straight Onward, Just As A Very Fresh Lubber Does On Deck, Or A Very Green Mount Does On Horseback; So With His Convulsive Efforts To Mount And Dismount. This Pupilage Is Brief, But We Always Have A Certain Respect For The Man Who Has Patiently<h2 id=the-boston-athletic-association>The Boston Athletic Association</h2><p>This Association was formed a short time ago by a number of gentlemen residing in and near Boston, and interested in various athletic sports. Grounds will be laid out at once inside the trotting track at Beacon Park, twelve minutes out on the Boston and Albany Railroad, and will comprise a track for walking and running, and fields for cricket, base ball, lawn tennis, lacrosse, foot ball, archery, and other sports. The assessment will be ten dollars per year, which will entitle members to all the advantages of the grounds and implements of the Association. J. Malcolm Forbes, 30 Sears Building, Boston, is chairman of the committee.<p>It is to be regretted that no provision has been made as yet for a path for bicycling. At one of the meetings it was suggested that one track would suffice for walking, running, and bicycling. That would be better than nothing, but it is not what is wanted. A properly constructed bicycle path should be made of cinders and binding gravel, and be kept perfectly hard and smooth; while a running track should be kept in a softer condition.<p>Now, gentlemen of the Association, there are upwards of five hundred bicyclers in and around Boston who are looking for a good, suitable track for racing and exercising, and the first track conveniently located, that meets the need, will gain their support. Should such a track be laid at Beacon Park, an additional membership of at least one hundred and fifty can be safely guaranteed, which would at least pay the expense of a three-lap track. Our sport is comparatively in its infancy, and should its future growth be as vigorous as its past has been, it will soon be a leading one. Can the Boston Athletic Association afford to ignore it, or to neglect the opportunity which it now offers?

Mr. Maurice Thompson must be surprised as well as pleased with the success that he has met with in persuading Americans to take up the weapons of our ancestors.<p>When an Archery Club was first talked of in our town, the greatest difficulty was found in trying to make people believe that it was not foolish for them to be interested in such a childish sport. In fact, the club would have hardly succeeded if it had not been organized as a social club, with Archery as only a minor attraction. Knowing that others have the same troubles, we want to make our experience of service to them, first in starting their club and then in selecting their bows and arrows and learning to shoot. If you wish to interest any one in Archery, give him a bow and let him try how many times he can hit the target out of thirty arrows, at forty yards. He will soon find that it calls for all the skill he has, as well as considerable strength. Let him keep up the practice day after day and he will soon find his strength and health improving, and his friends will be asking what makes his shoulders so much straighter. By this time he will have learned how to hit the target twice out of three arrows, have become interested in trying to beat you, and will privately vow to keep up his practice till his form is as erect as an Apollo.<p>No reasonable being has any doubt as to the benefit of open-air amusements, the only question being, which is the best? And we propose to show that Archery is the best. Other things being equal, the exercise that will most improve the health and strength is the best. Let us take one or two instances of what Archery has done. A lady who could hardly walk a mile last spring, now walks to the range, more than a mile distant, and shoots ninety arrows both morning and afternoon. A gentleman has added one inch to his chest and three-fourths of an inch to his fore-arm measures by three months' practice. Besides this, the carriage and form are greatly improved. Tennis may do as much for the muscles, but every posture is not as full of grace as in Archery. No one need think from this talk about the benefits to health, that increased strength is all the pleasure to be derived from Archery; far from it. Who would dare to advocate an amusement that would leave flirting out from the list of its attractions? Archery has just as good opportunities as any other amusement, not even excepting croquet, while it has this advantage over all, that it can make lovers useful in hunting arrows. The targets make an excellent screen, and the "happy hunting grounds" are usually occupied.<p>But those who have been shooting this past season know these things already; let us say something for them. Though the cold weather has made us lay aside our bows and hang up our quivers, we have by no means forgotten the pleasure of last summer's shooting, and we are making up our minds to practise more next year, in order to bring home a prize from the association meeting next fall. In the meantime, let us read all we can find about Archery, and study the science of shooting. Most of us have learned something in our practice that would be of general interest and benefit to the great body of archers. Why not then use a little time in writing out the results we have obtained, and in making our experience useful for the general good. These columns will be open for discussion of all matters pertaining to Archery, and let us hope that we may learn what weight arrows and what kind of bows are the best to use; so that we may not change our minds with the advice of our old gray-haired friend, who thinks that we are using too heavy a bow, and who tells of the wonderful score he has seen made with 4-3 arrows.<h1 id=relative-athletics>RELATIVE ATHLETICS</h1><p><strong>PEDS vs. WHEELIPEDS.</strong> - A comparison of the results of the bicycle long race won by Waller in September last, and the pedestrian contest in June, when E. P. Weston was the winner, each for six days, affords the best practical test so far as to the relative powers of the bicycler and the man afoot, for long distance. It shows for the leader 1,404 miles in the one case, against but 550 (and that somewhat doubtful) in the other, which is as 2.55 is to 1. This, too, was done in 108 hours, against nearly 142 hours. If the men on wheels, instead of being limited to 18 hours a day, should "go as they please" in that respect, a much higher ratio in favor of the bicycle is probable. They have not done their best yet so nearly as have the pedestrians; and it is expected that the facts will soon confirm the ratio indicated by recent theoretical estimates, which is as 3 to 1. D.<h3 id=court-reports>COURT REPORTS</h3><h4 id=mcfarland-v-brown>McFARLAND v. BROWN.</h4><p>This was an action of tort for alleged damages done to the plaintiff's horse, wagon, and contents, by the defendant, in Whitinsville, Mass., brought in the Second District Court of Southern Worcester, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Trial at Uxbridge, 8 November, 1879, before Zadoc Taft, Esquire, Associate Justice.<p>It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff, Robert McFarland, a milkman, had left his team in charge of two boys, aged respectively twelve and ten years, while he went to deliver milk at a house; that the boys had driven on to the house of the next customer and were just stopping the horse on a bank in front of the house, when the defendant, John E. Brown (of the Worcester Bi. C.), came round a bend in the road 600 yards distant, travelling at the rate of about six miles an hour; that the horse became nervous at sight of the bicycle, began to dance, started down the bank into the road, and when the wheels struck the gutter turned so abruptly around that the wagon was tipped over, the milk spilled, and the boys severely jarred; and that the horse ran off with the forward wheels and broke the harness before he was stopped. The plaintiff showed that the horse was one that he had long known and had used for two years in his business, and was afraid of nothing he had ever met before. It was also in evidence that when the defendant saw that a catastrophe was imminent, he dismounted and stood by his machine, about 75 yards distant; and that his travelling from Providence to Worcester, came around a turn in the road a few moments later, and saw Mr. Brown standing at the distance named, and the overturned wagon. I was also offered and admitted as to the number of bicycles in use in this country; their increasing popularity; their widespread use abroad; their affording a means of recreation to persons of too moderate means to keep a horse; their use about cities for business purposes, and their practicability for ordinary travel over country roads, as shown by the summer trips of the Boston Bicycle Club and many excursions of the Worcester Bicycle Club.<h2 id=glances-abroad>Glances Abroad</h2><p>ONE George Tomlinson has been sentenced to four months hard labor, in England, for stealing bicycles.<p>ON the 3d November, a 100 miles race was held at Bingley Hall, Birmingham, on a course eleven ( ! ) laps to the mile, wherein W.

Terront took the lead from the start, and maintained it to the end. His first seventeen and a half miles was made in exactly one hour, his first fifty miles in 3h. 6m. 48s., when he had a lead of two miles. and his average speed throughout was at the rate of fourteen miles per hour.

L. CORTIS. - On Saturday, the 18th October, the Stamford Bridge Grounds (Eng.) were thronged with thousands of spectators to witness the races of the "Bicycle Union," the chief among which were those between Keen and Cortis. Mr. Cortis (of the Wanderers' Club) is one of the fastest amateur riders in England, and is generally too well known to need introduction here. The races between these men, one being a professional and the other an amateur, were held with special sanction of the Bicycle Union. After the less important races had been decided, the<h3 id=one-mile-race>One-Mile Race</h3><p>was called. Cortis rode a 60-inch and, amid cheering cheers of the spectators, was a winner by not more than eleven inches. Time, 2m. 52.5s.<h3 id=the-five-mile-race>The Five-Mile Race</h3><p>The tactics of the mile race were again repeated, Cortis taking the lead from the start and maintaining it, with Keen close at his heels. Keen again put on one of his magnificent bursts of speed, overlapped his opponent, and came in a winner by nearly two feet. Time for the five miles, 15m. 30s.<p>The contrast in the form of the two men was very noticeable; Cortis bending over his handles at almost a right angle, and in many cases wobbling very badly, while Keen sat erect in the saddle, with his wheel running in true lines, and always under the most perfect control.<p>This makes the third race between these men, the victories now standing, two to Keen and one to Cortis.<h2 id=our-exchanges>Our Exchanges</h2><h2 id=advice-to-professional-men>Advice To Professional Men</h2><p>To professional men, men of business, and, indeed, all who are engaged in pursuits requiring more or less severe mental work, coupled with more or less confinement, exercise is, of course, the conditio sine qua non of the recreation to be recommended. The fact is so obvious (says a writer in the Nineteenth Century) that I need not dwell upon it further than to make one remark. This is to warn all such persons that feelings are no safe guide as to the amount of muscular exercise that is requisite for maintaining full and sustained health. By habitual neglect of sufficient exercise, the system may, and does, accommodate itself to such neglect; so that not only may the desire for exercise cease to be a fair measure of its need, but positive exhaustion may attend a much less amount of exercise than is necessary to long continuance of sound health. However strong and well, therefore, a man may feel notwithstanding his neglect of exercise, he ought to remember that he is playing a most dangerous game, and that sooner or later his sin will find him out—either in the form of dyspepsia, liver, kidney, or other disease, which so surely creep upon the offender against nature's laws of health. According to Dr. Parkes, the amount of exercise that a healthy man ought to take without fatigue is at the least that which is required for raising 150 foot-tons per diem. This, in mere walking, would, in the case of a man of ordinary weight, be represented by a walk of between eight and nine miles along level ground, or one mile up a tolerably steep hill; but it is desirable that the requisite amount of exercise should be obtained without throwing all the work upon one set of muscles. For this reason walking ought to be varied with rowing, riding, active games, and, where practicable, hunting or shooting, which, to those who are fond of sport, constitute the most perfect form of recreative exercise. - Scientific American.<p>THE ANGLO-FRENCH party of visiting bicyclers made their first appearance at Boston, and have at once established themselves in popular favor. Stanton is still suffering from a recently fractured collar-bone, and is, as yet, seen to a great disadvantage. Keen has proven himself already the prince of short-distance riders, both in style and speed. Cann is a patient and tireless plodder, while Terront, the mercurial Frenchman, is equally at home in long or short races, and eats, drinks, and almost sleeps without dismounting. The tour of these men throughout our principal cities will awaken popular interest in a sport hitherto wonderfully neglected in this country, and bicycle riders and clubs will soon be as numerous as are now our amateur athletic clubs. - Spirit of the Times.<p>Journal is no more. The paper has changed hands and appears this week in a handsome new dress, under the head of THE BICYCLING WORLD. It will be published every fortnight, at 40 Water street, and will be conducted by Mr. Charles E. Pratt.
